Jarosław Kaczyński (Polish pronunciation: [jaˈrɔswaf kaˈtʂɨj̃skʲi] (listen); born 18 June 1949) is a Polish politician and lawyer, and the current leader of the Law and Justice party (PiS by its Polish acronym), which he co-founded in 2001 with his identical twin brother, the late Polish President Lech Kaczyński. Running for PiS, he served as Prime Minister of Poland from July 2006 to November 2007, while his brother was President of Poland. Kaczynski brothers were the first pair of brothers in the world to serve as President and Prime Minister of a country and the only twin brothers to achieve the feat. After PiS's electoral defeat in 2007, Kaczyński was the main leader of the Opposition to Civic Platform's governments.
Following the death of his brother in a plane crash, Jarosław Kaczyński ran against Acting President Bronisław Komorowski in the Polish presidential election on 20 June 2010, but lost.
Despite not being the PiS candidate for either President or Prime Minister, Kaczyński is widely considered to have had a considerable influence on the PiS victories in both the 2015 presidential and 2015 parliamentary elections. Even though he does not serve as either prime minister or president, and is formally just a member of the Sejm, he is considered the most influential man in Poland, as well as an influential leader in the European Union.
