Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi (Arabic: حسين بدر الدين الحوثي‎;‎ 20 August 1959 – 10 September 2004), also spelled Hussein Badr Eddin al-Houthi, was a Zaidi religious, political and military leader, as well as former member of the Yemeni parliament for the Al-Haqq party between 1993 and 1997. He was instrumental in the Houthi insurgency against the Yemeni government, which began in 2004. Al-Houthi, who was a one-time rising political aspirant in Yemen, had wide religious and tribal backing in northern Yemen's mountainous regions. The Houthi movement took his name after his assassination in 2004.
