Murry Gage Wilson (July 2, 1917 â€“ June 4, 1973) was an American musician, record producer, and businessman who acted as the first manager of the Beach Boys, a rock band formed by his sons Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, his nephew Mike Love, and their friend Al Jardine. For most of the 1960s, Murry also worked as a music publisher for the band.
After the Beach Boys dismissed Murry as their manager in 1964, he produced the sound-alike group the Sunrays, and recorded a single solo album: The Many Moods of Murry Wilson (1967). In 1969, Wilson sold off their publishing company Sea of Tunes for $700,000 (equivalent to $4.88 million in 2019), then considered an undervalued sum. In 1973, he died aged 55 of a heart attack.
