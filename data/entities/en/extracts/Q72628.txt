Alfred von Kiderlen-Waechter (10 July 1852 – 30 December 1912, né Alfred Kiderlen) was a German diplomat and politician, who served as Secretary of State and head of the Foreign Office from 27 June 1910 to 30 December 1912. He is best known for his reckless role in the Agadir Crisis in 1911, when France militarily expanded its control of Morocco.  He demanded compensation in an aggressive, saber-rattling fashion, sending a warship to the scene and whipping up nationalist sentiment inside Germany. A compromise was reached with France whereby France took control of Morocco and gave Germany a slice of the French Congo.  However, the British were angry at this aggressiveness, and talked of war.  The episode, small itself, permanently soured relations between Berlin and London.
