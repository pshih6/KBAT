Carlos Reygadas Castillo (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈkaɾlos reiˈɣaðas]; born October 10, 1971) is a Mexican filmmaker. Influenced by existentialist art and philosophy, Reygadas' movies feature spiritual journeys into the inner worlds of his main characters, through which themes of love, suffering, death, and life's meaning are explored.
Reygadas has been described as "the one-man third wave of Mexican cinema"; his works are generally considered art films, and are known for their expressionistic cinematography, long takes, and emotionally charged stories. His first and third films, Japón (2002) and Silent Light (2007), made him one of Latin America's most prominent writer-directors, with various critics having named Silent Light as one of the best films of its decade. His films Battle in Heaven (2005) and Post Tenebras Lux (2012) divided critics.
He has co-produced other directors such as Amat Escalante (Sangre, Los Bastardos, Heli), Carlos Serrano Azcona (The Tree) or Pedro Aguilera (The Influence).
