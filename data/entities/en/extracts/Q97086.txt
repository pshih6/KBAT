Ludwig Kalisch (7 September 1814 in Lissa – 3 March 1882 in Paris) was a German-Jewish novelist.
When only twelve years of age he left his home and became successively pedler, merchant, and teacher. He saved enough money to carry him through matriculation and the study of medicine and, later, languages and literature in Heidelberg and Munich. Settling in Mainz in 1843, he became editor of the Narrhalla (1843–46). A participant in the revolution of 1848-49, he was forced to leave Germany. He went to Paris, in 1850 to London, and from 1851 onward lived in Paris.
