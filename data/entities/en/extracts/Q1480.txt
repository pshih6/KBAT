Maria Corazon Cojuangco Aquino (born Maria Corazon Sumulong Cojuangco; 25 January 1933 â€“ 1 August 2009) was a Filipino politician who served as the 11th President of the Philippines, becoming the first woman to hold that office.

In late 1985, Marcos called for a snap election, and Aquino ran for president with former senator Salvador Laurel as her running mate for vice president. After the election held on 7 February 1986, the Batasang Pambansa proclaimed Marcos and his running mate Arturo Tolentino as the winners; allegations were made of electoral fraud, with Aquino calling for massive civil disobedience actions. Defections from the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the support of the local Catholic hierarchy led to the People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos and secured Aquino's accession on 25 February 1986.
