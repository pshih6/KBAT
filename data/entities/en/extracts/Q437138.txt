Erzsébet Házy (Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈɛrʒeːbɛt ˈhaːzi]; October 1, 1929 – November 24, 1982) was a Hungarian operatic soprano. She fascinated the critics (see 'Critics' below) and audience not only with her voice but also with perfect acting and her beauty. She was particularly admired for her portrayal of the title heroine in Giacomo Puccini’s Manon Lescaut.
