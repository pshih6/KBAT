after the quake (神の子どもたちはみな踊る, Kami no Kodomo-tachi wa Mina Odoru, lit. "All God's Children Can Dance") is a collection of six short stories by Japanese author Haruki Murakami, written between 1999 and 2000. First published in Japan in 2000, it was released in English as after the quake in 2002 (translator Jay Rubin notes that Murakami "insisted" the title "should be all lower-case").
