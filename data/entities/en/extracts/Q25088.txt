Muhammad ibn Ali al-Jawwad (Arabic: مُحَمَّد ٱبْن عَلِيّ ٱلْجوَّاد‎, Muḥammad ibn ʿAlīy al-Jawwād, c. 12 April 811 – 29 November 835) was the ninth of the Twelve Imams and a descendant of Muhammad. He was also called Abu Ja'far, Ibn al-Ridha ("the son of al-Riha); al-Jawwād ("the generous") and al-Taqī ("the pious"). His role is celebrated by the largest branch of Shia Islam, the Twelver or Athnā‘ashariyyah branch. According to Shiite accounts, he was poisoned by his wife and died at age 25, the shortest-lived of the Twelve.
