The Institut d'optique Graduate School ("Institute of optics"), nicknamed "SupOptique" or "IOGS", is one of the most prestigious French Grandes Ecoles and the leading French grande école in the field of optics and its industrial and scientific applications, and a member of the prestigious University of Paris-Saclay, and ParisTech. The École supérieure d'optique was opened in 1920, as part of the Institut d'optique théorique et appliquée, aiming to train engineers and cadres for the French optics industry. It is consequently the oldest institution of higher education and research in optics in the world   and the most important in term of annual number of graduates.
The Institut d'optique Graduate School provides an education of high scientific level, specially for former students from the French Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles. It trains engineers to be, in industry and research, the actors of the development of optics in many areas such as telecommunications, biology, energy, materials, nanotechnologies, aerospace engineering. It trains also researchers and teachers in the fields of optics and physics. Through the Institut d'optique théorique et appliquée, it participates at the world level to the promotion of knowledges and to the development of new techniques in optics
Since September 2006, the set constituted by  the École supérieure d'optique and the Institut d'optique théorique et appliquée has been designated by the names "Institut d'optique Graduate School" or Institut d'optique.
