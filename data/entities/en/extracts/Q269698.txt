Marilyn Burns (born Mary Lynn Ann Burns; May 7, 1949 â€“ August 5, 2014) was an American actress. While in high school, Burns made her film debut as a tour guide in Robert Altman's experimental comedy film Brewster McCloud (1970), followed by minor appearances in low-budget independent films where her scenes were ultimately deleted such as Sidney Lumet's drama film Lovin' Molly (1974).
Burns was known for her collaborations with filmmaker Tobe Hooper, having appeared in two of his films. In 1974, she found box-office success with her leading role as Sally Hardesty in Hooper's exploitation horror film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), a role she later reprised in Kim Henkel's sequel Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1994).
Her other film roles include Faye in another Hooper film entitled Eaten Alive (1977), Dorothy Grim in Future-Kill (1985), and Verna Carson in Texas Chainsaw 3D (2013). She is also known for portraying Linda Kasabian in the television miniseries Helter Skelter (1976) which garnered three Primetime Emmy Award nominations.
