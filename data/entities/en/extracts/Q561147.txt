Joan Fuster i Ortells (Valencian pronunciation: [ʒuˈam fusˈteɾ j oɾˈteʎs]; 23 November 1922 – 21 June 1992) was an influential Spanish writer. He is considered a major writer in Valencian-Catalan language, and his work contributed to reinvigorate left-wing, pro-Catalan nationalism in Valencia during the Spanish transition to democracy. In his influential political essay Nosaltres, els valencians (1962) he coined the term Països Catalans (Catalan Countries) to refer to the Catalan-speaking territories, for which he claimed independent statehood from Spain.
