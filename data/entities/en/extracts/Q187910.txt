Veit Arnpeck (1440â€“1505) was a Bavarian historian from Landshut. He was educated at Amberg and Vienna and later became parish priest of St. Martin's Church, Landshut and chaplain to Bishop Sixtus. He is considered a significant figure in the development of Bavarian history and was praised by Aventin as one of his most important predecessors. His works include Chronicon Austriacum down to 1488 (Pez, Script. rer. Austr., I, 1165), Liber de gestis episcoporum Frisingensium (Deutinger, Beitr. z. Gesch. d. Erzbisth. Munch.-Fries., III), and the Chronicon Baioariorum (Pez, Thesaurus, III, ii, 19 sq.).
