Lloyd Price (born March 9, 1933) is an American R&B vocalist, known as "Mr. Personality", after his 1959 million-selling hit, "Personality".  His first recording, "Lawdy Miss Clawdy", was a hit for Specialty Records in 1952.  He continued to release records, but none were as popular until several years later, when he refined the New Orleans beat and achieved a series of national hits. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. He is also the earliest solo act who is still alive to earn a Billboard Hot 100 number-one single with "Stagger Lee".
