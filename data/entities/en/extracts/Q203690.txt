Brian Samuel Epstein (; 19 September 1934 â€“ 27 August 1967) was an English music entrepreneur who managed the Beatles from January 1962 until his death. He was referred to as the "fifth Beatle" due to his role in the group's business affairs, image and rise to global fame.
Epstein was born into a family of successful retailers in Liverpool, who put him in charge of their music shop. Here he displayed a gift for talent-spotting. He first met the Beatles in 1961 at a lunchtime concert at Liverpool's Cavern Club. Although he had no experience of artist management, Epstein put them under contract and insisted that they abandon their scruff-image in favour of a new clean-cut style, with identical suits and haircuts. He then persuaded George Martin of EMI group to produce their records.
Within months, the Beatles were international stars. Epstein accompanied them to America, where he was besieged by merchandising offers, but had signed away 90 per cent of the rights in advance. This is viewed as his one miscalculation. Some of Epstein's other young discoveries had also prospered at this time under his management. They included Gerry and the Pacemakers, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, Tommy Quickly, and Cilla Black. In 1967, he died of a drug overdose, ruled as accidental, at the age of 32.
