The death of Neda Agha-Soltan (Persian: ندا آقاسلطان‎ – Nedâ Âghâ-Soltân; 23 January 1983 – 20 June 2009) drew worldwide attention after she was shot dead during the 2009 Iranian election protests. Agha-Soltan, a student of philosophy, was participating in the protests with her music teacher, and was walking back to her car when she was fatally shot in the chest.
Eyewitnesses are reported by western sources as saying Agha-Soltan was shot by the Basij, a paramilitary organization. Her death was captured on video by bystanders and broadcast over the Internet, and the video became a rallying point for the opposition. Agha-Soltan's death became iconic in the struggle of Iranian protesters against the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
