Deborah Jane Kerr-Trimmer CBE (30 September 1921 â€“ 16 October 2007), known professionally as Deborah Kerr (), was a Scottish film, theatre and television actress. During her international film career, she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance as Anna Leonowens in the musical film The King and I (1956). As well as The King and I, her films include: An Affair to Remember (1957), The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943), Black Narcissus (1947), From Here to Eternity (1953), Tea and Sympathy (1956), Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957), Separate Tables (1958), The Innocents (1961), The Sundowners (1960), The Grass is Greener (1960), and The Night of the Iguana (1964). 
Deborah Kerr was nominated six times for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and holds the record for an actress most nominated in the lead actress category without winning. In 1994, however, having already received honorary awards from the Cannes Film Festival and BAFTA, Kerr received an Academy Honorary Award with a citation recognising her as "an artist of impeccable grace and beauty, a dedicated actress whose motion picture career has always stood for perfection, discipline and elegance".
