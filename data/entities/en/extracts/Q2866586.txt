Ashraf Marwan (Arabic: أشرف مروان‎‎, 2 February 1944 – 27 June 2007) was an Egyptian billionaire. Marwan worked as a spy for the Israeli Mossad, though some contend that he was a double agent who, on behalf of Egypt, gained the confidence of Israel, who thought he was a spy for the Israeli intelligence agency during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, feeding Israel strategic information on the location of Egyptian military assets. He gave Israel enough information to secure their trust and thus was able to mislead Israel regarding the timing of Egypt's attack in the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
From 1969, Marwan served in the Presidential Office, first under Gamal Abdel Nasser and, then as a close aide to his successor, President Anwar Sadat. In 2002 it became known that, during the period leading up to the October 1973 Yom Kippur War, Marwan spied for Israel (under the Mossad code-name "The Angel").  His warning on 5 October 1973 that "war will start tomorrow", triggered an emergency Israeli military mobilization and prevented both a complete surprise on 6 October and the complete occupation of the Golan Heights by the Syrian Army a day later. Marwan died under mysterious circumstances in June 2007, falling from the balcony of his expensive London house.
Maj. Gen. (ret.) Zvi Zamir, the Mossad Chief who was one of Marwan's handlers, describes him as "the best source we have ever had". Simon Parkin, a British journalist who investigated the case, regards him as the "20th century's greatest spy". There was a claim that Marwan was a "double-spy" who worked for Sadat and deceived the Israelis, but analysis of the evidence indicates Marwan's intelligence information was too destructive of Egyptian interests.
