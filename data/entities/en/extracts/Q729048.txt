Olavo Luiz Pimentel de Carvalho  (born 29 April 1947) is a Brazilian polemicist, self-promoted philosopher, political pundit, former astrologer and journalist living since 2005 in Richmond, Virginia.While publishing about politics, literature and philosophy since the 1980s, he made himself known to wider Brazilian audiences from the 1990s on, mainly writing columns for some of Brazil's major media outlets, such as the newspaper O Globo. In the 2000s, he began to use personal blogs and social media to convey his strongly conservative and anti-communist ideas. In the late 2010s, he rose to prominence in the Brazilian public debate, being dubbed the "intellectual father of the new right" and the ideologue of Jair Bolsonaro, a label that he has rejected.As a polemicist, Carvalho has been praised for not complying with political correctness and criticized for often resorting to obscene ad hominem attacks. His books and articles have spread conspiracy theories and false information, and he has been accused of fomenting hate speech and anti-intellectualism. He positions himself as a critic of modernity. His interests include historical philosophy, the history of revolutionary movements, the Traditionalist School and comparative religion. His views are rejected by many philosophers.
