Born in Barrington Passage, Nova Scotia, Wishart Robertson was educated in a Nova Scotia high school. He moved to Brooklyn, United States, to enter business, but returned to Canada in 1916 to join the 219th Battalion and then the 85th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force as a lieutenant. In 1918, he returned to Canada following World War I, and entered the automobile industry. In 1919, Robertson married Ethel Walker. He eventually became president and manager of Argyle Motor Services Ltd. and of Robertson Motors Ltd. of Halifax, Nova Scotia.
In 1928, he was elected to the provincial legislature, representing the riding previously held by his father and grandfather before him had represented. He did not run for re-election in 1933. In 1943, he was elected President of the National Liberal Federation of Canada, and was appointed to the Senate of Canada on February 19 of that year.
