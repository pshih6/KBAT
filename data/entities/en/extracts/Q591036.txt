Great Expectations is a three-part BBC television drama adaptation by Sarah Phelps of the Charles Dickensâ€™s 1861 novel of the same name, starring Ray Winstone as Magwitch, Gillian Anderson as Miss Havisham, Douglas Booth as Pip, Vanessa Kirby as Estella and David Suchet as Jaggers. The adaptation was first broadcast on British television over the Christmas period in 2011.
Anderson's casting as Miss Havisham drew attention to the production due to her being a mere 43 compared to other actresses who have played her. However, critical reception was generally positive.
In 2012, the PBS broadcast earned the series a total of four Creative Arts Emmy Awards out of five nominations for Outstanding Art Direction, Cinematography, Costumes, and Main Title Design. The remaining nomination was for Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music.
