He passed his Abitur in Gumbinnen (today Gusev, Russia) and started to study Lutheran theology at the University of Königsberg, but volunteered for the German Imperial Army at the outbreak of World War I. After the war, he worked as a journalist and became the chief editor of a local newspaper in Greifswald. He was dismissed as editor in 1935 because of his critical attitude towards the Nazis.
