Bishop's University (French: Universit√© Bishop's) is a small liberal arts university in Lennoxville, a borough of Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. It is one of three universities in the province of Quebec that teach primarily in English (the others being McGill University and Concordia University, both in Montreal). The university shares a campus with its neighbour, Champlain College Lennoxville, an English-language public college. It remains one of Canada's few primarily undergraduate universities, and is linked with three others in the Maple League. Established in 1843 as Bishop's College and affiliated with the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in 1853, the school remained under the Anglican church's direction from its founding until 1947. Since that time, the university has been a non-denominational institution.  Bishop's University has graduated fifteen Rhodes Scholars. It is ranked number one in Canada for student satisfaction by Maclean's magazine.
