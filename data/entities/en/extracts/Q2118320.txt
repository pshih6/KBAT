Alexander Ivanov (Russian: Александр Иванов, born October 27, 1962) is a Russian art collector who lives in Moscow. He is best known for the Fabergé Museum in Baden-Baden, which is the first private Russian-owned museum outside of Russia. Ivanov has no business holdings or interests, but the value of his massive art collection makes him a billionaire. In spring 2010, he said that a Middle Eastern collector offered him $2 billion for his Fabergé collection, the world's largest Fabergé jewellery collection with more than 3,000 items. Ivanov's tastes extend to many areas, and he also collects dinosaur fossils, ancient Greek and Roman art, pre-Columbian gold, Old Master paintings, Impressionist paintings, Orthodox icons, and he also has one of the finest collections of vintage automobiles.Ivanov's most significant purchase was the 1902 Fabergé egg made as an engagement gift to Baron Édouard de Rothschild. Ivanov bought it at Christie's in London on November 28, 2007, for 9 million pounds ($18.5 million at the time), because he thought that it is Fabergé’s "finest ever."
