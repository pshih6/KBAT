Mind Ripper (also known as The Hills Have Eyes III, The Hills Still Have Eyes, or The Outpost) is a 1995 American horror film released on HBO. It stars Lance Henriksen and Giovanni Ribisi.
Although it is marketed in some areas as a sequel to the original The Hills Have Eyes and The Hills Have Eyes Part II, no actors, characters, or scenarios link it to those films. Its only connection is producer Wes Craven, who wrote and directed the other two films. His son, Jonathan Craven, is credited as a writer.
