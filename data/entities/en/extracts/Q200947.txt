Ibn Fadlan (Arabic: أحمد بن فضلان بن العباس بن راشد بن حماد‎ Aḥmad ibn Faḍlān ibn al-ʿAbbās ibn Rāšid ibn Ḥammād, fl. 921–22) was a 10th-century Arab Muslim traveler, famous for his account of his travels as a member of an embassy of the Abbasid Caliph of Baghdad to the king of the Volga Bulgars, known as his Risala ("account" or "journal").
His account is most notable for providing a detailed description of the Volga Vikings, including an eyewitness account of a ship burial.
