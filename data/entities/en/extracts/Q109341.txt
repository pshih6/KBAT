Herbert Fischer (1914â€“2006) was a German diplomat, indologist and the ambassador of the erstwhile German Democratic Republic to India from 1972 to 1976. Born on 10 April 1914 in Herrnhut, in East Germany to a craftsman, he migrated to western Europe in 1933 where he did his schooling and moved to India in 1936 which gave him the opportunity to get acquainted with Gandhiji. After the Indian independence in 1947, he went back to the German Democratic Republic and joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1956. He served as the Chief of East German Trade Mission in the late 1960s before becoming the East German ambassador to India in 1972. He was the author of many Indological books which included Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, a biography of the Indian leader. He was a recipient of the Patriotic Order of Merit III Class. The Government of India awarded him the third highest civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan, in 2003, for his contributions to public affairs.
