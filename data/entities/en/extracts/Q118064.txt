Johann Heinrich Meyer (16 March 1760, Stäfa, Zürich - 14 October 1832, Jena) was a Swiss painter and art writer active in Weimar. A pupil of Henry Fuseli, he went to Rome in 1784, and befriended Goethe in 1787, becoming his right-hand-man in artistic matters (with the nicknames Kunschtmeyer and Goethemeyer). From 1791 he lived in Weimar, working from 1806 as director of its Fürstlichen freien Zeichenschule.
