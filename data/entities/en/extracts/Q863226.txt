William Haislip Squier (, born May 12, 1950) is an American rock musician and singer, who had a string of arena rock and crossover hits in the early 1980's. His best known and most favoured songs include "The Stroke", "Lonely Is the Night", "My Kinda Lover", "In the Dark", "Rock Me Tonite", "Everybody Wants You", "Emotions in Motion", "Love Is the Hero" and "The Big Beat". Squier's best selling album, 1981's Don't Say No, is considered a landmark release within the arena rock genre and bridging the gap between power pop and hard rock.
Described as a personification of early 80's rock music, Squier's most successful period ranges from 1981 to 1984, during which he scored five Top 10 Mainstream Rock hits (two of which were number ones), two Top 20 singles and three consecutive platinum selling albums, along with cyclic MTV rotation and radio airplay. Even after largely falling out from favour and chart success mostly because of the disastrous video for his 1984 hit "Rock Me Tonite", Squier has maintained his presence on the rock radio up to this day and attracted a strong cult following during the last decades, with his music being featured on many films and video games. Squier stepped out of music business after the release of his 1993 release Tell the Truth, but he has occasionally continued performing smaller tours and one-off performances.
His 1980 song "The Big Beat" is one of the most sampled drum breaks ever, being used by artists such as Run-DMC, Alicia Keys, Jay-Z, UTFO and Dizzee Rascal, to name a few. "The Stroke" has also shared its fair amount of sampling, most notably in Eminem's 2013 hit "Berzerk".
