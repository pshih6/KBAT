The series stars Jude Law as the disruptive Pope Pius XIII and Diane Keaton as his confidante Sister Mary, in a Vatican full of intrigues. It is co-produced by European production companies: Wildside, Haut et Court TV, and Mediapro.
The world premiere of The Young Pope was on 3 September 2016 at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival, where the first two episodes were screened out of the competition, the first time in the history of the festival that a TV series has been a part of the program. The series premiered on television on 21 October 2016 on Sky Atlantic in Italy.

However, Wildside producer Lorenzo Mieli announced on 20 October 2016 that a second season of the series was in development. Later, the project was revealed to be a follow-up miniseries called The New Pope, with Law returning and joined by John Malkovich, whose production began in Italy in late 2018.On 14 July 2017, The Young Pope received two nominations for the 69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first Italian TV series to be nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards.
