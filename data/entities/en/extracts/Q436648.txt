Richard James Edwards (born 22 December 1967 â€“ disappeared 1 February 1995), also known as Richey James or Richey Manic, was a Welsh musician who was the lyricist and rhythm guitarist of the alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. He was known for his dark, politicised and intellectual songwriting which, combined with an enigmatic and eloquent character, has assured him cult status, as well as having been cited by some as a leading lyricist of his generation, leading a movement now known as Cool Cymru.Edwards disappeared on 1 February 1995. On 24 November 2008, it was announced that his parents had obtained a court order, issued by the Probate Registry of Wales, naming them as executors of his estate and further stating that he died "on or since" 1 February 1995. The ninth album by Manic Street Preachers, Journal for Plague Lovers, released on 18 May 2009, is composed entirely of songs with lyrics left behind by Edwards. As of 2005, the remaining members of Manic Street Preachers were still paying 25% royalties into an account in his name.
