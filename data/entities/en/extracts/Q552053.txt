Paul von Jankó (2 June 1856 – 17 March 1919) was a Hungarian pianist and engineer.He first studied mathematics and music in Vienna, where he was a pupil of H. Schmitt, J. Krenn and Anton Bruckner. He then moved to Berlin where he during the years 1881 and 1882 studied mathematics at the city's University, and piano with H. Erlich.
In 1882 Jankó patented the Jankó keyboard, with six rows of keys, drawing upon earlier designs by Conrad Henfling (1708), Johann Rohleder (1791) and William Lunn (1843). From the year 1886 he used this instrument at his own concert journeys. The Norwegian pianist Tekla Nathan Bjerke was a pupil of Jankó, and played many concerts in Norway using this instrument. The Jankó keyboard wasn't used by many people as it was hard for them to relearn new fingering on a strange keyboard.
