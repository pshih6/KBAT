Robert Allen Pease (August 22, 1940 â€“ June 18, 2011) was an analog integrated circuit design expert and technical author. He  designed several very successful "best-seller" integrated circuits, many of them in continuous production for multiple decades. These include the LM331 voltage-to-frequency converter, and the LM337 adjustable negative voltage regulator (complement to the LM317).
