Bo Kuangyi (born 17 December 1987), more commonly known as Bo Guagua, is the second son of former Chinese politician Bo Xilai, and the only child of Gu Kailai, his father's second wife. Bo attended Harrow School, read PPE at Oxford University, and studied for a master's degree at Harvard University. In 2016, Bo graduated from Columbia Law School with a Juris Doctor degree.
Because his father was a high-ranking Communist Party official, Bo Guagua's life has been an occasional topic of news media gossip, which intensified and gained considerable international attention when his father was removed from office in March 2012. Both his parents came under investigation in the alleged homicide of family friend Neil Heywood, who also reportedly helped Bo during his time in the UK.Bo's father is often described as a "princeling" (offspring of Communist Party elite); his lifestyle and privileges typify those of fuerdai, and far exceed those of regular Chinese people of his age.
