Ernst Heilmann (13 April 1881 â€“ 3 April 1940) was a German jurist and politician of the Social Democratic Party of Germany.
Born in Berlin in what was then Prussia, Heilmann attended the University of Berlin, majoring in law and political science. In World War I, he was a proponent of the German party truce (Burgfriedenspolitik). Heilman gained a seat in the Reichstag in the 1928 German federal election. Not long after Hitler and the Nazi's seized power (Machtergreifung), Heilmann was arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned in the first of a series of concentration camps in which he was to spend nearly seven years. From September 1938 on he was kept in Buchenwald concentration camp, where he was executed in April 1940.
