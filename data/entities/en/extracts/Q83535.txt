Aerolíneas Argentinas, formally Aerolíneas Argentinas S.A., is Argentina's largest airline and the country's flag carrier. The airline was created in 1949 from the merger of four companies, and started operations in December 1950 (1950-12). A consortium led by Iberia took control of the airline in 1990, and Grupo Marsans acquired the company and its subsidiaries in 2001, following a period of severe financial difficulties that put the airline on the brink of closure. The company has been run by the Argentine government since late 2008, when the country regained control of the airline after it was taken over from the Spanish owners. As of December 2014, Aerolíneas Argentinas was state-owned. It has its headquarters in Buenos Aires. SkyTeam membership was achieved in late August 2012 (2012-08); the airline's cargo division became a member of SkyTeam Cargo in November 2013 (2013-11).
Aerolíneas Argentinas and its sister company Austral Líneas Aéreas operates from two hubs, both located in Buenos Aires: Aeroparque Jorge Newbery and Ministro Pistarini International Airport. Its narrow body fleet, used on domestic and regional routes, consists of Boeing 737–700, 737-800 and 737 MAX 8, whereas intercontinental and transoceanic services are flown on the wide body Airbus A330-200 and A340-300.
