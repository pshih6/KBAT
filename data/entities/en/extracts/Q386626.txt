Pickering (2016 population 91,771) is a city located in Southern Ontario, Canada, immediately east of Toronto in Durham Region. It was occupied for centuries by the Iroquoian-speaking Huron (now known as the Wyandot).
Beginning in the 1770s, the area was settled by primarily ethnic British colonists. An increase in population occurred after the American Revolutionary War, when the Crown resettled Loyalists and encouraged new immigration. Many of the smaller rural communities have been preserved and function as provincially significant historic sites and museums. The city also includes the development of Durham Live, a multi-billion dollar casino complex.
