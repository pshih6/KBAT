TaleSpin is an American animated television series based in the fictional city of Cape Suzette, which first aired in 1990 as a preview on Disney Channel and later that year as part of The Disney Afternoon, with characters adapted from Disney's 1967 animated feature The Jungle Book (namely, some of the film's animals being given an anthropomorphical makeover while the humans are removed), which was theatrically rereleased in the summer before this show premiered in the fall. The name of the show is a play on "tailspin", the rapid descent of an aircraft in a steep spiral. The two words in the show's name, tale and spin, are a way to describe telling a story. The show is one of ten Disney Afternoon shows to use established Disney characters as the main characters, with the others being Darkwing Duck, DuckTales, Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers, Goof Troop, Bonkers, Quack Pack, Aladdin, and Timon & Pumbaa. It is also one of two animated television series based on The Jungle Book, the second being Jungle Cubs.
