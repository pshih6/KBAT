Laâyoune ( lah-YOON, also UK:  ly-, French: [la.ajun]) or El Aaiún ( EL eye-(Y)OON, Spanish: [el (a)aˈʝun]; Hassaniya Arabic: لعيون, romanized: Laʕyūn/Elʕyūn; Berber languages: ⵍⵄⵢⵓⵏ, romanized: Leɛyun; Literary Arabic: العيون‎, romanized: al-ʿUyūn, lit. 'The Springs') is the largest city of the disputed territory of Western Sahara and de facto administered by Morocco. The modern city is thought to have been founded by the Spanish colonizer Antonio de Oro in 1938. In 1940, Spain designated it as the capital of the Spanish Sahara. Laâyoune (El Aaiún) is the capital of the Laâyoune-Sakia El Hamra region administered by Morocco under the supervision of the UN peace-keeping mission in Western Sahara (MINURSO).
The town is divided in two by the dry river of Saguia el-Hamra. On the south side is the old lower town, constructed by Spanish colonists. A cathedral from that era is still active; its priests serve this city and Dakhla further south. Most people in Laayoune have Moroccan heritage.
