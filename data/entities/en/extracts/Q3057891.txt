Pedro Eleodoro Paulet Mostajo (July 2, 1874 â€“ January 30, 1945) was a Peruvian diplomat who allegedly in 1895 was the first person to build a liquid-propellant rocket engine and, in 1900, the first person to build a modern rocket propulsion system. German V-2 inventor Wernher von Braun considered Paulet one of the "fathers of aeronautics." The National Air & Space Museum in Washington, D.C., has a small plaque honoring the memory of Paulet.
