The Aktionsgruppe Banat was a literary society that fought for freedom of speech, founded by German-speaking authors of the Banat Swabian minority in the Romanian Banat in 1972. The society suffered persecution from the communist authorities and the Securitate secret police, and was eventually dissolved by the communist authorities in 1975.
