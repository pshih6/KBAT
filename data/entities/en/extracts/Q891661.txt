Alexey Nikolayevich Titov (Russian: Алексей Николаевич Титов; July 12, 1769 - November 8, 1827), was a Russian composer and violinist. His son, Nikolai Titov, was a composer, as were several other family members.
Titov was born and died in St. Petersburg.  Alongside his musical career, Titov was a major general in the Russian cavalry. His music, most of which is for the stage (operas, ballets, and incidental music), was primarily written for local St. Petersburg theater and dance companies. Strong Russian themes run through his choice of libretti, and his music makes copious use of Russian folk music. He was most popular for his comic operas such as Yam, or The Post Station (1805), The Winter Party, or The Sequel to Yam (1808) and The Wedding Eve Party, or Filakin's Wedding (1809), which form a trilogy. All of them were staged in St. Petersburg.
