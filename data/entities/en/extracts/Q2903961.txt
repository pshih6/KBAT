Binnya Dhammaraza (Mon: ဗညာ ဓမ္မရာဇာ, Burmese: ဗညား ဓမ္မရာဇာ, Burmese pronunciation: [bəɲá dəma̰jàzà]; also spelled Banya Dhamma Yaza; 1393–1424) was king of Hanthawaddy Pegu from 1421 to 1424. His short reign was marked by rebellions by his half-brothers Binnya Ran and Binnya Kyan; renewed invasions by the Ava Kingdom; and various court intrigues. He never had any real control beyond the capital Pegu (Bago), and was poisoned by one of his queens in 1424. He was succeeded by Binnya Ran.
