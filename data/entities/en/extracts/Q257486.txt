Waterloo Bridge is a 1931 American pre-Code drama film directed by James Whale and starring Mae Clarke, Kent Douglass, Doris Lloyd, and Bette Davis. The screenplay by Benn Levy and Tom Reed is based on the 1930 Waterloo Bridge by Robert E. Sherwood.
The film was remade in 1940 as Waterloo Bridge and as Gaby in 1956. Both remakes were made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which bought the 1931 version from Universal. Today, the rights to all three films are held by Warner Bros. and their subsidiary Turner Entertainment.
