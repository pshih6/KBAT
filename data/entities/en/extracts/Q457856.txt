Jessica Lucy 'Decca' Freeman-Mitford (11 September 1917 â€“ 22 July 1996) was an English author, one of the six aristocratic Mitford sisters noted for their sharply conflicting politics.
Jessica, who represented the far left, married her second cousin Esmond Romilly, killed in World War II, and then American civil rights lawyer Robert Treuhaft, with whom she joined the American Communist Party and worked closely in the Civil Rights Congress. Both refused to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee, but later resigned from the party out of disillusion with Stalinism.
Her memoirs Hons and Rebels, and a social commentary The American Way of Death, both became classics.
