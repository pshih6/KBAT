Adolf Busemann (20 April 1901 â€“ 3 November 1986) was a German aerospace engineer and influential Nazi-era pioneer in aerodynamics, specialising in supersonic airflows. He introduced the concept of swept wings, and after immigrating in  1947 to the United States (see Operation Paperclip) invented the shockwave free Busemann's Biplane.
