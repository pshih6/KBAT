Dragnet is a 1987 American buddy cop comedy film, directed and co-written by Tom Mankiewicz in his directorial debut. Starring Dan Aykroyd and Tom Hanks, the film is based on the radio and television crime drama of the same name. The screenplay, both a parody of and homage to the long-running television series, was written by Aykroyd, Mankiewicz and Alan Zweibel. The original music score is by Ira Newborn.
Aykroyd plays Joe Friday (nephew of the original series protagonist) while Hanks plays Pep Streebek, his new partner. Harry Morgan reprises his role from the television series as Bill Gannon, now a captain and Friday and Streebek's boss.
