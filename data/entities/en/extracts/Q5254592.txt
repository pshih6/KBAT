Delta Chi (ΔΧ) is an international Greek letter collegiate social fraternity formed on October 13, 1890, at Cornell University, initially as a professional fraternity for law students. On April 30, 1922, Delta Chi became a general membership social fraternity, eliminating the requirement for men to be studying law, and opening membership to all areas of study. Delta Chi became one of the first international fraternities to abolish "hell week", when it did so on April 22, 1929. Delta Chi is a charter member of the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC). As of Fall 2019, Delta Chi has initiated over 116,000 members at over 110 Chapters and Colonies, with 34 Alumni Chapters. Its headquarters is in Indianapolis, Indiana.
