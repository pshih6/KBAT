Axalp is a high alpine pasture in the Bernese Oberland, on the northern slope of Axalphorn, overlooking Lake Brienz, today part of Brienz municipality.
Axalp was historically the name of the high pastures (alps), on the northern slopes of the Axalpburg, Tschingel and Axalphorn peaks, between c. 1500 m and 1900 m (46.712°N 8.046°E﻿ / 46.712; 8.046).
Axalp was developed as a tourist resort since the late 19th century, and as a ski resort since the 1960s.
In the later 20th century, the name of the pasture has been transferred to the ski resort, including the infrastructure, hotels and chalets built up below Axalp proper, between 1400 m and 1500 m.
