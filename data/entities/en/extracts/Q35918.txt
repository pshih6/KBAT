Nu Virgos (Ukrainian: ВІА Гра) was the name used to promote the musical group VIA Gra (ВИА Гра) outside of Ukraine and other nearby countries. The name VIA Gra is a triple wordplay: it is an allusion to the drug Viagra, also the first three letters "ВІА" ("VIA") stand for "vocal-instrumental ensemble" in Ukrainian, and "Гра" ("hra") means "game" or "play" in Ukrainian, and it is also kind of a signature of the surnames of the two first girls of the group, VI-nnytsk-A and GRA-novska, the originally used maiden name of Nadya Meikher. Nu Virgos was a Ukrainian girl group that hit the charts in Ukraine and Russia in September 2000 with their first single "Popytka No. 5" ("Attempt No. 5").
