Francisco "Kit" Sarmiento Tatad (born October 4, 1939) is a Filipino journalist and politician best known for having served as Minister of Public Information under President Ferdinand Marcos from 1969 to 1980, and for serving as a Senator of the Philippines from 1992 to 2001.
When Marcos first appointed Tatad as Minister of Public Information in 1969, he became the youngest member of Marcos' cabinet. During his term as Minister of Public Information, he announced the declaration of Martial Law on September 23, 1972, reading the text on air at 3:00 in the afternoon, five hours before Marcos himself would come on air to explain his justifications for the declaration, at 7:15 on the same date. While serving as cabinet secretary, he concurrently became a member of the Batasang Pambansa.
As a Senator, he served as Senate Majority Floor Leader from 1996 to 1998 and again from 2000 to 2001. Another historical moment in Tatad's career came in 2001, when he was one of the 11 senators who voted against opening an envelope that had been alleged to contain incriminating evidence against then Philippine President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, inciting events that led to the EDSA Revolution of 2001.
