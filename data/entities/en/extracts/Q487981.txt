Benidorm (; Valencian: [beniˈðɔɾm]; Spanish: [beniˈðoɾ]) is a city and municipality in the province of Alicante (Valencian Community), on Spain's Mediterranean coast.
Benidorm has been a tourist destination within Spain since 1925, when its port was extended and the first hotels were built. However, the real "boom" of Benidorm as a coastal resort did not happen until the 1950s, when it became a famous summer destination for people coming from inland Spain, especially Madrid. Today it is known for its hotel industry, beaches and skyscrapers and receives as many or even slightly more foreign tourists as Spanish ones. According to the 2014 census, Benidorm has a permanent population of 69,010 inhabitants, making it the fifth most populous town in the Alicante province and the ninth in Valencian Community.
