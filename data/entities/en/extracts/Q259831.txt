It Rains on Our Love (Swedish: Det regnar på vår kärlek) is a 1946 Swedish drama film directed by Ingmar Bergman.  The screenplay was written by Herbert Grevenius and Bergman, based on the Norwegian play Bra Mennesker (Good People) by Oskar Braaten.  It Rains on Our Love is the first film directed by Bergman to include actor Gunnar Björnstrand in a credited role (he also had a credited role in Bergman's screenwriting debut Torment (1944)).  Björnstrand would go on to act in nearly twenty of Bergman's films.
