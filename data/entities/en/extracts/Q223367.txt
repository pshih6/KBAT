The Queen is a 2006 British biographical drama film that depicts the death of Diana, Princess of Wales on 31 August 1997. Initially, the Royal Family regard Diana's death as a private affair and thus not to be treated as an official royal death. This is in contrast with the views of Tony Blair and Diana's ex-husband, Prince Charles, who favour the general public's desire for an official expression of grief. Matters are further complicated by the media, royal protocol regarding Diana's official status, and wider issues about republicanism.
The film was directed by Stephen Frears, written by Peter Morgan, and starred Helen Mirren in the title role of Queen Elizabeth II. The film's production and release coincided with a revival of favourable public sentiment in respect to the monarchy, a downturn in fortunes for Tony Blair, and the British inquiry into the death of Diana. Michael Sheen reprised his role as Tony Blair from The Deal in 2003, and he did so again in The Special Relationship in 2010. The Queen also garnered general critical and popular acclaim for Mirren in the title role, which earned her numerous awards, namely the Academy Award for Best Actress. Mirren was praised by the Queen herself and was invited to dinner at Buckingham Palace. However, Mirren could not attend due to filming commitments in Hollywood.
