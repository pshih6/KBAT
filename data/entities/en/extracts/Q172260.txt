The Lovers (previously known as Singularity, released in the UK as Time Traveller and in Belgium under the French title La Prophétie de l'anneau) is a 2013 English-language romance time travel adventure film directed by Roland Joffé and written by Ajey Jhankar. The film stars Josh Hartnett, Bipasha Basu, Alice Englert, Tamsin Egerton and Abhay Deol in lead roles. The film is the tale of an impossible romance set against the backdrop of the first Anglo-Maratha war across two time periods and continents and centred on four characters—a British officer in 18th century British India, the Indian woman he falls deeply in love with, and a 21st-century American marine biologist and his wife.
