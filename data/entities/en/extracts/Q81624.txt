Anthony Patrick Hadley (born 2 June 1960) is an English singer-songwriter, occasional stage actor and radio presenter. He rose to fame in the 1980s as the lead singer of the New Romantic band Spandau Ballet and launched a solo career following the group's split in 1990.
Hadley is known for his suave image, as well as his powerful voice, which has been described by AllMusic as a "dramatic warble". Music journalist and author Dave Rimmer described his voice as "like a foghornâ€”if a foghorn could be imagined trying to emulate both [Frank] Sinatra and [David] Bowie". His Spandau Ballet bandmate Steve Norman described him as having "a massive vocal range". According to Tim Rice, Hadley has a "strong and expressive voice that few of his contemporaries came near to matching".
