The Institute of Philosophy was founded as the Institute of Scientific Philosophy in 1921 by Gustav Shpet, who was its first director until 1923. The philosophy department of the University of Moscow had been disbanded in the summer of 1921, however philosophers such as Semyon Frank and Ivan Ilyin attempted to set up temporary courses at the new institute. However, the Bolsheviks soon put a stop to this and Frank and Ilyin where amongst the deportees sent into exile on the philosophers' ships. Shpet's name was put forward for deportation but Anatoli Lunacharsky, the People's Commissar for Education, intervened and he was allowed to remain in Russia.
