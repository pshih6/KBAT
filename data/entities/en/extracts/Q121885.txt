Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe (5 December 1924 â€“ 27 February 1978) was a prominent South African political dissident and teacher, who founded the Pan Africanist Congress in opposition to the South African apartheid system. In 2004, Sobukwe was voted 42nd in the SABC3's Great South Africans. 
During his lifetime, Sobukwe was considered to be so dangerous by the National Party government that its parliament enacted the "Sobukwe clause", a statute which on its face seemed to grant broadly applicable powers, but was specifically intended to authorise the arbitrary extension of Sobukwe's imprisonment.
