The Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts (Swedish: Kungliga Akademien f√∂r de fria konsterna), commonly called the Royal Academy, is located in Stockholm, Sweden. An  independent organization that promotes the development of painting, sculpture, architecture, and other fine arts, it is one of several Swedish Royal Academies. The Royal Institute of Art, an art school that was once an integral part of the Academy, was broken out in 1978 as an independent entity directly under the supervision of the Ministry of Education.
