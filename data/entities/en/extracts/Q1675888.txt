Ivan Morozov (Ива́н Абра́мович Морóзов, November 27, 1871 – July 21, 1921) was a Russian businessman and from 1907 to 1914, a major collector of avant-garde French art.
After the Bolshevik Revolution, his art collection was nationalized and divided between the Pushkin Museum, Moscow, and the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad.
Morozov's art collection has been jointly displayed with the collection of Sergei Shchukin. In 2008, the families of Morozov and Shchukin made efforts to compel Russia to provide them with “reasonable compensation,” which become an international legal and political issue. The families refused an offer of £5,000 to each family from the British Royal Academy in exchange for their promise not to make claims on the paintings while they were on loan to the Royal Academy for a special exhibition of the two collections in London.
