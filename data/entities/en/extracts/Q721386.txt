John Donald Imus Jr. (July 23, 1940 â€“ December 27, 2019), better known as Don Imus or simply Imus was an American radio personality, television show host, recording artist, and author. His radio show Imus in the Morning aired on various stations and digital platforms nationwide until 2018.
In 1968 he began his first radio job, at KUTY, in Palmdale, California. Three years later, he landed the morning broadcast position at WNBC, in New York City. Imus was fired from WNBC in 1977, then rehired, in 1979, remaining at the station until it left the air in 1988, at which time his show moved to WFAN, which took over WNBC's former frequency of 660 kHz. Following Howard Stern's success with national syndication, Imus in the Morning adopted the same model in 1993.
Throughout his later career, Imus was labeled a "shock jock". He was fired by CBS Radio in April 2007 after describing the Rutgers University women's basketball team as "nappy-headed hoes".
In January 2018, Cumulus Media, in the middle of a bankruptcy process, told Imus they were going to stop paying him, and as a result, Imus ended his show. His final show was on March 29, 2018. He died the following year of complications from lung disease.
