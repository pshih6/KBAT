Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt, commonly referred to by its German acronym, ANRW, or in English as Rise and Decline of the Roman World, is an extensive collection of books dealing with the history and culture of ancient Rome. Akin to a journal and published in various series, each number of the ANRW comprises scholarly essays contributed by individual authors. The essays are in various modern European languages, but are primarily written in German or English. 
The series is currently published in its second series (Part 2), the Principat series (that is, relating to the period of the Roman Principate).
