Mikhail Fyodorovich Larionov (Russian: Михаи́л Фёдорович Ларио́нов; June 3, 1881 – May 10, 1964) was an avant-garde Russian painter. Larionov was also the lifelong partner of fellow Russian avant-garde artist Natalia Goncharova. He was a founding member of the Jack of Diamonds (1909–1911), Moscow's first radical independent exhibiting group, the more radical Donkey's Tail (1912–1913), and with Goncharova he invented Rayonism (1912–1914). He was also a member of the German-based art movement known as Der Blaue Reiter. Born in Russia, he and Goncharova moved to Paris and lived there until his death.
