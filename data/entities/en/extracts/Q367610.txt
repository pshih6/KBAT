Barefoot in the Park is a 1967 American romantic comedy film starring Jane Fonda and Robert Redford. Based on Neil Simon's 1963 play of the same name, it focuses on newlyweds Corie and Paul Bratter and their adventures living in a minuscule fifth floor walk-up apartment in a Greenwich Village brownstone. Stuffed-shirt Paul is a hard-working young attorney just starting his practice, while spontaneous bride Corie is determined to create a romantic environment in two rooms without heat, a hole in the skylight, and oddball neighbors.
The title refers to Corie's lamentation that Paul will not go running barefoot in Washington Square Park with her because of his sober and cautious demeanor. The phrase becomes emblematic of the differences between the two of them, and is made manifest in the film's climactic scene.
The film's screenplay was written by Simon. Gene Saks directed Redford, reprising his Broadway role of Paul, and Fonda, who replaced the play's Elizabeth Ashley. Mildred Natwick reprises her stage role as the bride's mother, Charles Boyer is featured as the eccentric upstairs neighbor, and Herb Edelman reprises his stage role as a telephone installer. The lead female role had been offered to Natalie Wood who had already played opposite Redford in two films. Wood declined the offer because she wanted to take time off from acting.
Natwick was nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, Fonda was nominated for a BAFTA as Best Foreign Actress, and Simon received a nod from the Writers Guild of America.
