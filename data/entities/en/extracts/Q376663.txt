Mean Machine is a 2001 British sports comedy film directed by Barry Skolnick and starring former footballer Vinnie Jones. The film is an adaptation of the 1974 American film The Longest Yard, featuring association football rather than American football. It also reunites most of the cast from executive producer Guy Ritchie's prior blockbusters Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch.
