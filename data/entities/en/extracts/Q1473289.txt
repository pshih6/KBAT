Middle French (French: moyen français) is a historical division of the French language that covers the period from the 14th to the early 17th centuries.  It is a period of transition during which:

the French language became clearly distinguished from the other competing Oïl languages, which are sometimes subsumed within the concept of Old French (l’ancien français)
the French language was imposed as the official language of the kingdom of France in place of Latin and other Oïl and Occitan languages
the literary development of French prepared the vocabulary and grammar for the Classical French (le français classique) spoken in the 17th and 18th centuries.
