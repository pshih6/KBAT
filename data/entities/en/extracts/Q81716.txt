Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (; French: [kulɔ̃]; 14 June  1736 – 23 August 1806) was a French military engineer and physicist. He is best known as the eponymous discoverer of what is now called Coulomb's law, the description of the electrostatic force of attraction and repulsion, though he also did important work on friction. 
The SI unit of electric charge, the coulomb, was named in his honor in 1908.
