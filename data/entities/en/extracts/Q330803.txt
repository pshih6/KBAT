After the Fox (Italian: Caccia alla volpe) is a 1966 Britishâ€“Italian heist comedy film directed by Vittorio De Sica and starring Peter Sellers, Victor Mature and Britt Ekland. The English-language screenplay is by Neil Simon and De Sica's longtime collaborator Cesare Zavattini.
Despite its notable credits, the film was poorly received when it was released. It has gained a cult following for its numerous in-jokes skewering pompous directors (including Cecil B. DeMille, Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni and De Sica); movie stars; their starstruck audiences; and pretentious film critics. The film was remade in 2010 in Hindi as Tees Maar Khan.
