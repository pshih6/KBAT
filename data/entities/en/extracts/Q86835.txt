Bettina Röhl (born 21 September 1962) is a German journalist and author.   She is best known for her writings about student radicalism of the 1960s  and the terrorist kidnappings that it spawned in West Germany during the early 1970s.   Röhl has written extensively about the former Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer's time as a leftwing militant leader.   She has also researched and written at length about her own mother, the journalist and Red Army Faction terrorist Ulrike Meinhof.   Her assessments of the violence associated with the Red Army Faction in the 1970s are at times insightful and intensely critical.
