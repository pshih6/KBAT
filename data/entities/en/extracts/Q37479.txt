Osmose Productions is a French independent record label created in 1991 by Herv√© Herbaut, after he had spent three years running a small mail order company. They specialize mainly in death and black metal bands.
Many of the groups who began with Osmose would move on to sign with larger labels, such as Nuclear Blast, Century Media and Metal Blade.
