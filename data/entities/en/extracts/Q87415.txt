Julius Tandler (February 16, 1869 â€“ August 25, 1936) was an Austrian physician and Social Democratic politician. His research secured him a lasting place in the history of anatomy. His main claim to fame, however, was his ambition to introduce a comprehensive system of public health and social services in the Vienna municipality in the interwar years.
