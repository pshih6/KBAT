Hans Michael Frank (23 May 1900 â€“ 16 October 1946) was a German politician and lawyer who served as head of the General Government in Poland during the Second World War.
Frank was an early member of the German Workers' Party, the precursor of the Nazi Party (NSDAP). He took part in the failed Beer Hall Putsch, and later became Adolf Hitler's personal legal adviser as well as the lawyer of the NSDAP. In 1933, Frank joined the Hitler Cabinet as Reich Minister without portfolio.
After the German invasion of Poland in 1939, Frank was appointed Governor-General of the occupied Polish territories. During his tenure, he instituted a reign of terror against the civilian population and became directly involved in the mass murder of Jews. He engaged in the use of forced labour and oversaw four of the extermination camps; the policies of enslavement and extermination would later be used extensively in conquered territories of the Soviet Union. By 1942 Frank had lost Hitler's favour, but remained head of the General Government until its collapse in early 1945.
After the war, Frank was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials. He was sentenced to death and executed by hanging in October 1946.
