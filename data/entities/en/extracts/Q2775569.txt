An engineer (United States and Canada), engine driver, loco pilot, motorman, or train driver (British and Commonwealth English), is a person who drives a train. The driver is in charge of, and responsible for operating the engine, as well as the mechanical operation of the train, train speed, and all train handling.
For many American  railroads, the following career progression is typical: assistant conductor (brakeman), train conductor and finally the engineer. For many years the Fireman was next in line to be an Engineer but that classification has been eliminated. In the US, drivers are required to be certified and re-certified every two to three years.  In American English a hostler moves engines around train yards, but does not take them out on the normal tracks; the British English equivalent is a shunter.
In India, a driver starts as a diesel assistant or electrical assistant (in case of electric locomotives). They then get promoted on a scale: goods, passenger, Mail/Express and Rajdhani/Shatabdi/Duronto.In the United States and Canada, train drivers are historically known as "locomotive engineers", or "handlers". 
In the United Kingdom, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia they are known as "train drivers", "engine drivers", "locomotive drivers", or "locomotive operators".
