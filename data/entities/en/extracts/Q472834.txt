Thai people, Central Thai (Thai: ชาวไทย) or Siamese (Thai: ชาวสยาม; historically and sometimes domestically), in a narrow sense, are a Tai ethnic group dominant in Central and Southern Thailand (Siamese proper). Part of the larger Tai ethno-linguistic group native to Southeast Asia as well as Southern China and Northeast India, Thais speak the Central Thai language, which is classified as part of the Kra–Dai family of languages. The majority of Thais are followers of Theravada Buddhism.
As a result of government policy during the 1930s and 1940s resulting in successful forced assimilation of many various ethno-linguistic groups in the country into the dominant Thai language and culture, the term Thai people has come to refer to the population of Thailand in general. This includes other subgroups of the Tai ethno-linguistic group, such as the Northern Thai people (Lanna) and the Isan people, as well as non-Tai groups, the largest of which is that of the ethnic Chinese.
