Jordanes (), also written Jordanis or, uncommonly, Jornandes, was a Gothic 6th-century Eastern Roman bureaucrat who became an historian later in life.
Jordanes wrote Romana, about the history of Rome, but his best-known work is his Getica, which was written in Constantinople about 551 AD. Along with Isidore of Seville's Historia Gothorum, it is one of only two extant ancient works dealing with the early history of the Goths.
Jordanes was asked by a friend to write Getica as a summary of a multi-volume history of the Goths by the statesman Cassiodorus that existed then but has since been lost. Jordanes was selected for his known interest in history, his ability to write succinctly, and because of his own Gothic background. He had been a high-level notarius, or secretary, of a small client state on the Roman frontier in Scythia Minor, modern southeastern Romania and northeastern Bulgaria.Other writers, such as Procopius, wrote works which are extant on the later history of the Goths. As the only surviving work on Gothic origins, Getica has been the object of much critical review. Jordanes wrote in Late Latin rather than the classical Ciceronian Latin. According to his own introduction, he had only three days to review what Cassiodorus had written, meaning that he must also have relied on his own knowledge.
