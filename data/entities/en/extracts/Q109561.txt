Friedrich Wilhelm German Mäurer (1811-1883) was a German Communist writer and leader of the early German labor movement. He joined the League of Outlaws because of his democratic beliefs. When the League of Outlaws became the League of the Just, Mäurer became a member of the League of the Just. He wrote poetry for its newsletters and several books, and with Moses Hess was an important link between it and Karl Marx.
