As of 2018, 99% of all new chips use a RISC architecture. He is also noted for leading the research on RAID storage together with Randy Katz.His books on computer architecture (co-authored with John L. Hennessy) are widely used in computer science education. Along with Hennessy, Patterson won the 2017 Turing Award for their work in developing RISC.
