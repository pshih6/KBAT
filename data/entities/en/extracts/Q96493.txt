Michael Sladek (born 1946) is a German doctor and bearer of the Bundesverdienstkreuz.
He became famous by realising a grid-independent system for producing electricity, by distributed little power plants. 
For this he was awarded 1996 by the German magazine Capital  with the Capital/ WWF - Umweltpreis. In 1999 he and his wife Ursula Sladek were awarded with the Nuclear-Free Future Award. In January 2004 the Sladek couple was awarded the highest order in Germany, the Bundesverdienstkreuz, for their great engagement for the environment.
With his system that combines an efficiency-strategy with a power saving strategy it became possible to satisfy the power consumption of the community Schönau in the Black-Forest. 
Following his engagement supported by his wife and many friends the first German green power-provider came into existence, the EWS Schönau.
The community of Schönau was the first community on Earth in a Western civilised country that became independent of the national power grid and could decide how the power will be produced.
