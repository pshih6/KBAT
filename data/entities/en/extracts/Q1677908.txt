Jacques Bizet (10 July 1872 - 3 November 1922) was a French physician and businessman best known for his childhood friendship with the novelist Marcel Proust, whom he predeceased by fifteen days when he committed suicide. The composer Georges Bizet (who died in 1875 when Jacques was not quite three) was his father.   His mother was the literary hostess, born Geneviève Halévy.   The essayist-historian Daniel Halévy (1872 – 1962) was a cousin.
