In August 2009, Carano fought Cris Cyborg in Strikeforce: Carano vs. Cyborg, the first time two women headlined a major MMA event; Cyborg won. Carano compiled a competitive record of 12–1–1 in Muay Thai and a 7–1 in women's MMA.Outside the ring, Carano performed as Crush in the revamped 2008 reality series American Gladiators. Carano has pursued a career in acting since she retired from competition. She made her film debut in the 2009 direct-to-DVD martial arts film Blood and Bone with Michael Jai White. She has subsequently appeared in Steven Soderbergh's 2011 action film Haywire, Fast & Furious 6 (2013), Deadpool (2016) and is now starring as Cara Dune in the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian.
