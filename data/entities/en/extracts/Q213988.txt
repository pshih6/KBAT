Skogskyrkogården (pronounced [ˈskûːɡsɕʏrkʊˌɡoːɖɛn]; Swedish for '"The Woodland Cemetery"') is a cemetery located in the Gamla Enskede district south of central Stockholm, Sweden. Its design, by Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz, reflects the development of architecture from Nordic Classicism to mature functionalism.
