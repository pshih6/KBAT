An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn (stylized on-screen as Burn Hollywood Burn) is a 1997 American mockumentary comedy film directed by Arthur Hiller (using the Alan Smithee pseudonym), written by Joe Eszterhas, and starring Eric Idle as the protagonist, a director unfortunately named Alan Smithee. The film follows Smithee as he steals the negatives to his latest film and goes on the run.
Critically panned, the film "won" five awards (including Worst Picture) at the 1998 Golden Raspberry Awards. 
The film's creation set off a chain of events which led the Directors Guild of America to officially discontinue the Alan Smithee credit in 2000. Its plot, about a director attempting to disown a film, ironically described the film's own production; director Hiller requested that his name be removed after witnessing the final cut of the film by the studio.
