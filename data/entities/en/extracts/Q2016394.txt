He is also a vice president of the Democratic Liberal Party of Romania, which was led by Emil Boc and the Minister of Economy in the Boc Cabinet, since 22 December 2008.
A businessman in the marble and granite industry, Videanu was elected mayor in early April 2005, gathering 53.01% of the Bucharest electorate's vote, but the turnout was the lowest since 1989, with only 24.83% of the voters turning up.  
Starting with 2008 Videanu is under corruption investigation regarding a business with raw materials for constructions (i.e. curbstones). His own companies were involved in the scandalous affair of the "curbstonization" of the Romanian capital city, Bucharest. Many streets from Romanian capital were paved with new curbstones imported from China during the period of 2006-2008. The traffic was severely disturbed, dissatisfying Bucharest inhabitants. According to some preliminary data Videanu's companies obtained illegally 4 million euros from state funds.On 29 January 2015 he was arrested for new corruption allegations.He and his wife Mioriţa have two children, Andrei-Valentin and Diana-Alexandra.
