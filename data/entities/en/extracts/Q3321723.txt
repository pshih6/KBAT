Queer Duck is an American adult animated comedy web television series produced by Icebox.com that originally appeared on Icebox.com and later moved to the American cable television channel Showtime in 2000, where it aired as a follow-up feature of the American version of Queer as Folk. Although far from being the first gay cartoon character, Queer Duck was the first animated TV series to have homosexuality as its predominant theme. Like several later television cartoons, Queer Duck was animated in Macromedia Flash.
The show was created, written and executive-produced by Mike Reiss who is the executive producer of network cartoons The Simpsons and The Critic. The animation was directed and designed by Xeth Feinberg. The theme song for the cartoon was performed by the drag queen celebrity RuPaul.
