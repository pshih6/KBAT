Johann "Jack" Unterweger (16 August 1951 â€“ 29 June 1994) was an Austrian serial killer who committed murder in several countries. Initially convicted in 1974 of a single murder, he began to write extensively while in prison. His work gained the attention of the Austrian literary elite, who took it as evidence that he had been rehabilitated. After significant lobbying, he was released on parole in 1990.
After his release, he became a minor celebrity and worked as a playwright and journalist, but within months he began to kill women serially. After being convicted of an additional nine murders in 1994, he committed suicide in prison by hanging himself.
