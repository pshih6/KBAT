"In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Garrett was heavily committed to the design of small gas turbine engines from 20 - 90 horse power (15 - 67 kW). The engineers had developed a good background in the metallurgy of housings, high speed seals, radial inflow turbines, and centrifugal compressors."In the 1950s and 1960s, Garrett's company diversified and expanded. Garrett AiResearch designed and produced a wide range of military and industrial products for aerospace and general industry.
Cliff Garrett died in 1963. In 1964, to avoid a hostile takeover of Garrett's assets by Curtiss-Wright, his corporation merged with Signal Oil and Gas Company to form the Signal Companies.
