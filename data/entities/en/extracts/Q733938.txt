"The Real" was added to the title after a dispute with Filmation and its Ghost Busters properties.There also were two ongoing Real Ghostbusters comics, one published monthly by Now Comics in the United States and the other published weekly (originally biweekly) by Marvel Comics in the United Kingdom. Kenner produced a line of action figures and playsets based on the cartoon.
