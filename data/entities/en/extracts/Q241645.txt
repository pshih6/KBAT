Bauru (Portuguese pronunciation: [bɐʊ̯ˈɾu]) is a Brazilian municipality in midwestern region of the state of São Paulo.  It is the main city of the mesoregion and microregion of Bauru. The population is 366,992 (2015 est.) in an area of 667.68 km². Established in 1896, its boundaries are Reginópolis to the north, Arealva to the northeast, Pederneiras to the east, Agudos and Piratininga to the south and Avaí to the west.
The presence of a strong service sector, many college campuses - including the University of São Paulo and Universidade Estadual Paulista - and the city's location at the junction of three railroads and three highways make Bauru a major urban center of the State of São Paulo.
It is the hometown of Marcos César Pontes, the first Brazilian in space.  It is also the town where Pelé grew up and learned his football skills.
The city is served by two airports: the older Bauru Airport, and the newer Bauru-Arealva Airport, officially known as Moussa Nakhl Tobias Airport, located in the adjoining municipality of Arealva.
