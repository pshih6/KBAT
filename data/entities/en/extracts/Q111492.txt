Mirko Bonné (born 9 June 1965) is a German writer and translator.
Bonné was born in Tegernsee, Bavaria. In 1975 his family moved to Hamburg, where he attended the Hansa Gymnasium. He graduated from the Otto Hahn Gymnasium in Geesthacht in 1986 and worked as a bookshop assistant, taxi driver and nurse. His writing career began in the early 1990s with journalism, moving on to lyric poetry and translations.
In his poetry, influenced by Keats, Trakl and Eich, he treats the themes of landscape, life, and memory, while his prose, which includes novels about Shackleton and Camus, concerns itself with the mechanisms of oppression. He has published travel writing about South America, Russia, China, the United States, Iran, and Antarctica, and translated Anderson, Dickinson, Keats, Cummings, Creeley, Yeats, and Gherasim Luca. He is a member of PEN Germany and lives in Hamburg.
