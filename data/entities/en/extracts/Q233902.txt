Park graduated from the Toho Gakuen College of Drama and Music in Yonsei University and studied Korean at the Korean Language Institute (한국어학당). Park has won numerous awards, including the best actress in a leading role for her portrayal of Nana Osaki at the Seiyu Awards. Park is known for her roles as tough, calm and mature preteen or teenage boys who are often called prodigies in their fictional universes (for example, Tao Ren, Ken Ichijouji, Tōshirō Hitsugaya, Edward Elric, Kosuke Ueki and Natsume Hyūga). Her female roles also fit the "tough/punk lady" archetype (Temari from Naruto, Nana Osaki and Teresa of the Faint Smile in Claymore).
