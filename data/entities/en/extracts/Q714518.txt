Ali Babacan (Turkish pronunciation: [aˈli babaˈdʒan]; born 4 April 1967) is a Turkish politician. He is member of the parliament and former Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey responsible for the Economy. He first served as the Minister of State in charge of economic affairs in the 58th cabinet from the Justice and Development Party (AK Party). He retained this position throughout the 58th and 59th Governments of the Republic of Turkey. On 29 August 2007 he was appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the 60th Government of the Republic of Turkey. During 2009–2015 he served as the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs of Turkey. He is married with three children. In 2019, Babacan left the AKP, citing “deep differences” over the party’s direction as a reason.
Babacan has hit out at the country's "misguided and populist" economic management launching a new party aimed at challenging the ruling Party. Babacan, at the hunch of his party - whose name translated to English means "the remedy" - said the public opinion perception of the government has now "seriously changed".
