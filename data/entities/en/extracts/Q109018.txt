Willi Kreikemeyer (1894 â€“ c. 1950) was a German labourer and a Communist. From 1941 he and his wife Marthe Kreikemeyer were close assistants of Noel Field who supported German anti-Nazi refugees in France and Switzerland. He died in East German detention as a victim of the Noel Field show trials, which had the function to replace Communist Party officials with others more aligned with Moscow.
