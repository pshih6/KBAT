Before forming Type O Negative, he had created the metal group Fallout and the thrash band Carnivore.As the frontman for Type O Negative, Steele was known for his vampiric effect, towering 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) stature, rich bass vocals, and a dark, often self-deprecating sense of humor. His lyrics have been described as "often intensely personal, dealing with subjects including love, loss and addiction." Steele credited Black Sabbath and the Beatles as his key musical influences. He has been listed among the "66 Best Hard Rock and Metal Frontmen of All Time" by Loudwire.
