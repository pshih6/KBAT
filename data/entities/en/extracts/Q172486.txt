Victor Wilson (14 April 1931 â€“ 14 January 2001) was a British racing driver.
Born in Hull and raised in South Africa, Wilson participated in two Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, the 1960 Italian Grand Prix at Monza and the 1966 Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps. In the former, he drove a private Cooper-Climax and retired just before half-distance, while in the latter he was entered in a private BRM but was forced to give his car to American Bob Bondurant before the race. He also participated in some non-Championship Formula One races.
After racing, Wilson worked as a motor dealer before dying in a motor accident at Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.
