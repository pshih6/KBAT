Raul Gardini (June 7, 1933 - July 23, 1993) was an Italian agri-business and chemicals tycoon. In 1980 he took the helm of his father in law Serafino Ferruzzi's family wealth, leading an aggressive campaign that led to the acquisition of the French sugar and paper company Beghin-Say SA, turning Ferruzzi into Europe's leading sugar producer. In 1985, Gardini focused his interest on chemicals and bought stock in the Montedison chemicals group. By 1987, he had acquired 42 per cent of the group, turning Ferruzzi-Montedison into Italy's second largest industrial group after the state-owned company Eni. In 1989 Eni and Montedison formed a joint-venture called Enimont.In 1992 Gardini built a sailing team to compete in the America's Cup. Paul Cayard was hired as manager and skipper, leading Il Moro di Venezia to win the 1992 Louis Vuitton Cup.
In 1993 Gardini was embroiled in the Tangentopoli scandal following a failed power bid to take control of Enimont and died by a dubious suicide in Milan.
