Margaret of Bavaria (1442â€“1479), was a Marchioness consort of Mantua, married in 1463 to Federico I Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua. She was the daughter of Albert III, Duke of Bavaria and Anna of Brunswick-Grubenhagen-Einbeck. The marriage between Margaret and Frederico helped trading relations between the two states. Margaret was hunch-backed and was not able to speak or read Italian when she arrived, but the relationship with Frederico was described as happy. The court was dominated by her mother-in-law, but Margaret avoided all conflicts. During his war against Aragon, Frederico appointed Margaret as regent in his absence during the spring and summer of 1479. She died during her reign.
