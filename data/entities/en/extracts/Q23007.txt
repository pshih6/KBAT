Leimen is a town in north-west Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is about 7 km (4.3 mi) south of Heidelberg and the third largest town of the Rhein-Neckar district after Weinheim and Sinsheim. It is also the area's industrial centre.
Leimen is located on the Bergstraße (Mountain Road) and on the Bertha Benz Memorial Route.
In the context of a communal reform in the 1970s, Leimen was newly created from the villages Leimen, Gauangelloch and Sankt Ilgen. In 1981, the state government of Baden-Württemberg granted Leimen the privilege to be called "town." When Leimen's population exceeded 20,000 in 1990, the city council applied for elevation to a Große Kreisstadt which was granted by the state government on April 1, 1992.
