Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a degenerative disease involving the gradual deterioration and death of specific volumes of the brain. The condition leads to symptoms including loss of balance, slowing of movement, difficulty moving the eyes, and dementia.  PSP may be mistaken for other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. The cause of the condition is uncertain, but involves accumulation of tau protein within the brain.  Medications such as levodopa and amantadine may be useful in some cases.PSP affects about six people per 100,000. The first symptoms typically occur in persons aged 60â€“70 years. Males are slightly more likely to be affected than females.  No association has been found between PSP and any particular race, location, or occupation.
