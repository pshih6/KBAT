Diplomat Records is an American hip hop record label founded by Harlem rapper Cam'ron. Dipset currently releases music under the independent label E1 music. In the early 2000s, Dipset was very popular for having star rappers with radio hits like Juelz Santana and Cam'ron and for their association with Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella records. In 2005, Dipset moved away from Roc-A-Fella and Cam'ron sold Juelz Santana's contract back to Def Jam. Between 2006 and 2009, Dipset was relatively quiet aside from Cam'ron and Jim Jones. However in 2010, they reunited and have begun to associate themselves with rapper Vado.
