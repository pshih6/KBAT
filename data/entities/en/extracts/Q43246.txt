The Bürgenstock is a mountain in Switzerland (1,115 m above sea level) located partway along the shore of Lake Lucerne. Bürgenstock is also a resort located at 874 m a.s.l. on the same mountain. The lookout point at the summit of the Bürgenstock, the Hammetschwand, offers an extensive view, for the mountain is almost entirely surrounded by Lake Lucerne.
The small resort Bürgenstock can be reached by a road as well as with the Bürgenstock Funicular which starts from the boat landing pier at Kehrsiten-Bürgenstock on Lake Lucerne. The highest summit of the Bürgenstock can be reached from the resort by foot and by means of a cliff-side path followed by the Hammetschwand Elevator.
The new Bürgenstock resort featuring 30 buildings, including three hotels with around 400 rooms (800 beds), 68 Residence Suites and 12 restaurants and bars is under construction. Of the total investment of CHF 485 million, CHF 320 million has already been expended. It reopens 2017.
