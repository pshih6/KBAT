Lutz Heilmann (born September 7, 1966 in Zittau, GDR) is a German politician of the left-wing party Die Linke. He was elected to the Bundestag in the 2005 federal election as a member of the party list in Schleswig-Holstein. Shortly thereafter it was revealed that he had worked for the Stasi (the East German secret police) from 1985 to 1990. Heilmann drew national and international media attention when he caused the website www.wikipedia.de (not the German Wikipedia, but a search portal for it run by Wikimedia Deutschland) to be blocked by a preliminary injunction on November 13, 2008. His Bundestag term ended in 2009, and he failed to be nominated for a second term.
