The Altmann is a mountain in the Appenzell Alps, located on the border between the cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden and St. Gallen. It is situated in the massif of the Alpstein north of Wildhaus (St. Gallen), a few kilometres from the SÃ¤ntis.
The Altmann is a steep limestone tower, which rises about 1000 metres over the valleys of the Alpstein. The normal route starts at Rotsteinpass (2,120 metres) on the north-west side and is considered an easy climb.
