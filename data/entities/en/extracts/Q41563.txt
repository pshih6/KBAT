Julia Eileen Gillard  (born 29 September 1961) is an Australian former politician who served as the 27th Prime Minister of Australia and Leader of the Australian Labor Party from 2010 to 2013. She was previously the 13th Deputy Prime Minister of Australia from 2007 until 2010 and held the cabinet positions of Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion from 2007 to 2010. She was the first and to date only woman to hold the positions of Deputy Prime Minister, Prime Minister and leader of a major party in Australia.
Born in Barry, Wales, Gillard migrated with her family to Adelaide, South Australia, in 1966. She attended Mitcham Demonstration School and Unley High School. Gillard went on to the University of Adelaide, but switched to the University of Melbourne in 1982, where she eventually graduated with Bachelor of Laws (1986) and Bachelor of Arts (1989) degrees. She worked with the Australian Union of Students during that time and was the organisation's president from 1983 to 1984. In 1987, Gillard joined the law firm Slater & Gordon. She became a partner in 1990, specialising in industrial law, but left in 1996 to become chief of staff to John Brumby, the leader of the Labor Party in Victoria. This preceded her own entry into federal politics.
Gillard was first elected to the House of Representatives at the 1998 federal election for the seat of Lalor. Following the 2001 election, she was elected to Shadow Cabinet. When Kevin Rudd was elected as party leader and Leader of the Opposition in December 2006, Gillard was elected unopposed as his deputy. Upon Labor's victory at the 2007 election, she became the first female Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, and was made Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. On 24 June 2010, after Rudd lost the support of his party and resigned, Gillard was elected unopposed as his replacement, thus becoming prime minister. The subsequent 2010 federal election saw the first hung parliament since 1940. Gillard was able to form a minority government with the support of a Green MP and three independents. On 26 June 2013, after a leadership spill, Gillard lost the leadership of the Labor Party back to Rudd. Her resignation as prime minister took effect the following day. Gillard retired from politics on 5 August 2013, before the impending federal election.
Following her departure from politics, Gillard became an honorary visiting professor at the University of Adelaide, and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center for Universal Education. She released her political memoir, My Story, in September 2014. She has been on the board of the mental health organisation Beyond Blue since December 2014 and its chair since July 2017, and was made an honorary fellow of Aberystwyth University in June 2015. Gillard has also served as the chairwoman of the Global Partnership for Education since February 2014.
