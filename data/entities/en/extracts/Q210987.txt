Salo (Finnish pronunciation: [ˈsɑlo]) is a town and municipality of Finland.
It is in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Southwest Finland region. The municipality has a population of 52,312 (January 31, 2019) and covers an area of 2,168.30 square kilometres (837.19 sq mi) of which 181.78 km2 (70.19 sq mi) is water. The population density is 26.33/km2 (68.2/sq mi).
In Finnish salo means woodland, backwoods but also a wooded island. It is thought that Salo has meant the island that over thousand years ago existed to the south of the current town but is today (due to the post-glacial rebound typical in the area) a hill, not even very close to the sea.Salo is located between the capital Helsinki and the provincial capital Turku, making it a busy small city. The short distance from these bigger cities keeps the Salo region and its business life growing. Farming also plays a considerable part in the area. Salo's neighbouring municipalities are Koski Tl, Lohja, Kemiönsaari, Marttila, Paimio, Raseborg, Sauvo and Somero.
Once the town's main claim to fame, Salo had a large consumer electronics and mobile phone industry, with a manufacturing plant operated by Nokia and briefly by Microsoft Mobile in the 2010s until it was shut down. Nokia was once the dominant employer in the town, and the plant's closure in 2015 has led to high unemployment.
Salo is the birthplace of the president of Finland Sauli Niinistö.
The municipality is unilingually Finnish.
