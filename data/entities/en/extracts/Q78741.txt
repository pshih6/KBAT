Baron Max Wladimir von Beck (6 September 1854, Vienna â€“ 20 January 1943, Vienna) was an Austrian statesman.
Baron Max Wladimir von Beck was recently selected as the main motif of an Austrian collectors' coin, the 100 Years of Universal Male Suffrage commemorative coin, minted on January 10, 2007. The coin design is based on a historic photo of the opening session of Parliament in 1907, right after the elections.  The two oval portraits in the foreground are of the Emperor Franz Joseph and the Baron, who were responsible for putting the reform through.
