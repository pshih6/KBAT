Minoru Mukaiya (向谷 実, Mukaiya Minoru, born 20 October 1956) is a Japanese musician best known as the former keyboardist of the jazz fusion band Casiopea and producer of the Train Simulator series of Japanese video games.
Mukaiya joined Casiopea in 1979 and remained in the group until their hiatus in 2006. Since leaving the band he has created his own musical production team, "Mukaiya Club." He also serves as the President and CEO of the company Ongakukan, which produces professional train simulators for Japanese transit systems and has distributed video games to the general public.
Mukuya has also appeared in the event of Nico Nico Douga.
While most train stations alert passengers with basic dings and dongs, metro riders in Japan are often treated to uniquely crafted melodies. Minoru Mukaiya is the mastermind behind these jingles—he's made around 200 distinct chimes for over 110 stations. In 2019, British television presenter James May interviewed Mukaiya for episode 3 of James May: Our Man in Japan, discussing Mukaiya's involvement in composing melodies for train stations.
