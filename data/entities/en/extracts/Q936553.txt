Manouchehr Atashi (Persian: منوچهر آتشی‎) (September 25, 1931 – November 20, 2005) was a Persian poet, writer, and journalist.
He was born in 1931 in Dashtestan, Bushehr province. His poetry is the poetry of the revolting warrior of the humiliated southern tribesman. He takes his work seriously and although attached to his native birthplace his poems are universal scope. In his later works Atashi has relaxed his rhythm and has moved toward direct expression of emotion.
