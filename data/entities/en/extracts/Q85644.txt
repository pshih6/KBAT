Otto Telschow (27 February 1876, Wittenberge, Brandenburg – 31 May 1945), a German Nazi Party official, was born in Wittenberge and became a police official in Hamburg. Telschow joined the German Social Party in 1905. In 1925 he joined the Nazi Party, and was the founder of the regional Nazi newspaper, the Niedersachsen-Stürmer. In October 1928, Telschow was appointed Gauleiter (regional party leader) of the Nazi party's regional subsection Gau Eastern Hanover, a post he retained until the end of World War II. Telschow gained more influence after 1935, when the Nazi-party Gaue usurped the functions of the streamlined German states. In 1930 he was elected to the Reichstag for the Ost-Hannover electoral district, and remained a member until 1945. He was taken prisoner by the British Army at Lüneburg and committed suicide in prison by slashing his wrists.
