Some Came Running is a 1958 American drama film directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Shirley MacLaine, based on the novel of the same name by James Jones. Set in 1948, it tells the story of a troubled Army veteran and author who returns to his  Midwestern hometown after 16 years, to the chagrin of his wealthy, social-climbing brother.
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, in a bid to duplicate the success of the multiâ€“Academy Award winning film adaptation of Jones' earlier novel, From Here to Eternity (1953), optioned the 1,200-plus-page book Some Came Running and cast Sinatra as the lead. Sinatra approved Dean Martin for the role of Bama, in what would be their first film together. MacLaine garnered her first Oscar nomination, which she credited to Sinatra for his insistence on changing the film's ending. The film was released in CinemaScope and Metrocolor.
