Euna Lee (Hangul: 리유나) (born 1972) is a Korean American journalist who has worked for Current TV since 2005.  
Lee and fellow journalist Laura Ling were detained in North Korea after they crossed into the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from the People's Republic of China without a visa. They were found guilty of illegal entry and sentenced to twelve years' hard labor in June 2009. The United States Government protested the sentences, and implemented diplomatic efforts in order to secure the release of both Lee and Ling.  On 4 August 2009, Lee and Ling were pardoned by the North Korean government after a special humanitarian visit by former U.S. President Bill Clinton.
