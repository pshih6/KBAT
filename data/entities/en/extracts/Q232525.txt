Theodelinda also spelled Theudelinde (c. 570â€“628 AD), was a queen of the Lombards by marriage to two consecutive Lombard rulers, Autari and then Agilulf, and regent of Lombardia during the minority of her son Adaloald, and co-regent when he reached majority, from 616 to 626. For well over thirty years, she exercised influence across the Lombard realm, which comprised most of Italy between the Apennines and the Alps. Born a Frank Catholic, she convinced her first spouse Autari to convert from pagan beliefs to Christianity.
