Lyskamm (German: Liskamm, formerly Lyskamm, literally "comb of the Lys"), also known as Silberbast (literally "silver bast"), is a mountain (4,527 m (14,852 ft)) in the Pennine Alps lying on the border between Switzerland and Italy. It consists of a five-kilometre-long ridge with two distinct peaks. The mountain has gained a reputation for seriousness because of the many cornices lying on the ridge and the frequent avalanches, thus leading to its nickname the Menschenfresser ("people eater").
