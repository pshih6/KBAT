Lai Man-Wai (Chinese: 黎民偉; pinyin: Li Minwei; 1893–1953), also romanised as Lay Min Wei or M.W. Ray, considered the "Father of Hong Kong Cinema", was the director of the first Hong Kong film Zhuangzi Tests His Wife in 1913. In the film, Lai played the role of the wife, partly due to the reluctance of women to participate in show business at the time.
