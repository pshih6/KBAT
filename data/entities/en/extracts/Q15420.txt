Granollers (Catalan pronunciation: [ɡɾənuˈʎes]) is a city in central Catalonia, about 30 kilometers northeast of Barcelona. It is the capital and most densely populated city of the comarca of Vallès Oriental.
Granollers is now a bustling business centre, having grown from a town dominated by Catalonia's textile industry that was so prominent during the 19th Century. However, in the southern portion of the municipality, the Palou area retains the agricultural characteristics of the past.Granollers forms a conurbation with Canovelles, Les Franqueses del Vallès and the neighbourhood of La Torreta in La Roca del Vallès. The city is crossed by the Congost river,  a tributary of the Besòs river. It is considered to be situated in the second crown of the Barcelona metropolitan area. It is around 25 km north-east of the centre of Barcelona.
