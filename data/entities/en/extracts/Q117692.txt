From 1910, he was also employed at the Federal Chancellery as translator then as secretary of the National Council from 1911, then finally as Vice-Chancellor from 1927. After the resignation of Robert Käslin, Bovet was elected Chancellor of Switzerland in 1935 following a difficult election facing SP candidate Oskar Leimgruber, who would eventually become Chancellor after Bovet.
