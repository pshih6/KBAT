Fair Game is a 1995 American action film directed by Andrew Sipes.  It stars Cindy Crawford as family law attorney Kate McQuean and William Baldwin as Max Kirkpatrick, a Florida police officer. Kirkpatrick ends up on the run to protect McQuean when she is targeted for murder by ex-members of the KGB with interests in a ship owned by a Cuban man who may lose it in a divorce case being pursued by McQuean.
The film is based on Paula Gosling's novel of the same title, which was previously adapted into the 1986 Sylvester Stallone film Cobra.
Locations used for the film included Coral Gables, Florida, Miami Beach, and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.
Fair Game was panned by critics, and is a box office bomb.
