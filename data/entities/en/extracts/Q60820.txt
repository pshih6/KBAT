Rolf Hochhuth (born 1 April 1931) is a German author and playwright. He is best known for his 1963 drama The Deputy, which insinuates Pope Pius XII's indifference to Hitler's extermination of the Jews, and he remains a controversial figure both for his plays and other public comments and for his 2005 defense of Holocaust denier David Irving.
