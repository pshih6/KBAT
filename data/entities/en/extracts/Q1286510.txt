James Edward "Snooky" Pryor (September 15, 1919 or 1921 â€“ October 18, 2006) was an American Chicago blues harmonica player.  He claimed to have pioneered the now-common method of playing amplified harmonica by cupping a small microphone in his hands along with the harmonica, although on his earliest records, in the late 1940s, he did not use this method.
