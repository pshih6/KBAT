Manuel "Manolo" Saiz Balbás (born 16 October 1959 in Torrelavega, Cantabria) is the former team manager of one of the most successful Spanish professional road bicycle racing teams, first called Team ONCE, then Liberty Seguros-Würth, Astana-Würth, and lastly Astana Team.
Saiz was a hands-on manager and directeur sportif.  He consolidated his riders' training and hired staff to manage their coaching and racing.
Despite not having a racing background, he nurtured ONCE to become one of the biggest teams.  His riders included Frenchman Laurent Jalabert and Swiss Alex Zülle; both dominated the Vuelta a España, each winning the general and other classifications.  In 1995 Jalabert achieved the trifecta by winning the general classification along with the points and King of the Mountains.
Saiz's next riders included Spaniard Abraham Olano, Igor González de Galdeano and Joseba Beloki.  ONCE dominated team time trials in the Tour de France.
At the end of the 2003 ONCE discontinued sponsorship, saying penetration was 100% in Spain, meaning every Spaniard knew what ONCE was.  Saiz brought Liberty Seguros (the Spanish branch of the US company Liberty Mutual) and Würth, a German assembly technology company to be co-sponsor.
