Alfredo Jorge Nobre da Costa, GCC, ComC, OMRI (Lisbon, Lapa, 10 September 1923 — Lisbon, 4 February 1996), commonly known just by Nobre da Costa (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈnɔbɾ(ɨ) dɐ ˈkɔʃtɐ]), was a Portuguese engineer and politician.
He was the only son of Alfredo Henrique Andresen da Costa (b. 4 November 1893), of Goan, Italian, French and/or Catalan, Danish and Portuguese ancestry, and wife Portuguese Maria Helena Nobre.
He graduated from Instituto Superior Técnico.
A moderate independent center-left politician, he was chosen by President António Ramalho Eanes to lead a government that would finish the four-year legislative term, which had been initiated in the 1976 Portuguese legislative election. His cabinet consisted of independents. However, it failed to gain a majority in the Assembly of the Republic, and Nobre da Costa resigned. He was replaced by Carlos Alberto da Mota Pinto.
He married on 5 May 1951 Maria de Lourdes de Carvalho e Cunha Fortes da Gama and had a single daughter Vera Maria Nobre da Costa (b. 5 February 1952).
