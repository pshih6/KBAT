The Lycée Pierre-Corneille (also known as the Lycée Corneille) is a state secondary school located in the city of Rouen, France. 
Originally founded by the Jesuits in 1593, the school was secularized following the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, and is today non-religious and ruled by the French Ministry of Education.
The school adopted the name of the playwright Pierre Corneille in 1873, and was classified as a national heritage site in December 1985.
