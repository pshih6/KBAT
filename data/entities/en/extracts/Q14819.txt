Freiberg is a university and former mining town in the Free State of Saxony, Germany. It is a so-called Gro√üe Kreisstadt (large county town) and the administrative centre of Mittelsachsen district.
Its historic town centre has been placed under heritage conservation and is a chosen site for the proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the Ore Mountain Mining Region. Until 1969, the town was dominated for around 800 years by the mining and smelting industries.

It is home of the oldest university of mining and metallurgy in the world - the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology.
