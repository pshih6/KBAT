Ernest-Antoine Seillière de Laborde (born 20 December 1937 in Neuilly-sur-Seine) is a French entrepreneur and the heir to the Wendel empire (representing €730 million).He is a member of Le Siècle think tank, an officer of the Légion d'honneur, and an officer of the Ordre National du Mérite. Contrary to popular belief, he is not a member of the French nobility and is therefore not a French baron (although his title is said to be authentic but papal).
His great-grandfather, Aimé Seillière (1835–1870) was married to Marie de Laborde (1844–1867) in 1865. His paternal grandfather is the French academician Ernest Seillière.
