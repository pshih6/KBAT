ROIR (pronounced "roar"), or Reachout International Records, is a New York City-based independent record label founded in 1979 by Neil Cooper.ROIR was founded the same year that the Sony Walkman launched, and initially, the label exclusively distributed its releases in cassette format.  Much of the label's catalog is now available in CD and LP formats.  
ROIR released its first cassette, by James Chance and the Contortions, in 1981. In 1982, ROIR released the compilation album New York Thrash, documenting the hardcore punk scene in the New York metropolitan area.

The label later branched out into other genres including hardcore punk, reggae, ska, psychedelia and dub.
