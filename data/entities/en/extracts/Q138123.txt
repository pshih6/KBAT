Mazari was an ethnic Hazara, and believed the solution to the internal divisions in Afghanistan was in a federal system of governance, with each ethnic group having specific constitutional rights and able to govern their own land and people. He was murdered by the Taliban in 1995, and posthumously given the title ‘Martyr Of National Unity’ in 2016. He supported equal representation of all ethnic groups of Afghanistan, especially Hazaras.who are still being persecuted by Afghan State.
