Jennifer McCarthy Wahlberg (n√©e Jennifer Ann McCarthy; born November 1, 1972) is an American actress, model, television host, satellite radio broadcaster, author, and anti-vaccine activist. She began her career in 1993 as a nude model for Playboy magazine and was later named their Playmate of the Year. McCarthy then had a television and film acting career, starting as a co-host on the MTV game show Singled Out, then some eponymous sitcoms, as well as films such as BASEketball, Diamonds, Scream 3, and Santa Baby. She is a former co-host of the ABC talk show The View. She is currently a judge on the Fox musical competition show The Masked Singer.
McCarthy has written books about parenting and has promoted research into environmental causes and alternative medical treatments for autism. She has promoted the disproven idea that vaccines cause autism, and she believes that chelation therapy, a dangerous quack cure helped cure her son of autism. McCarthy's views have been considered dangerous, reckless, and uninformed. McCarthy has been described as "the nation's most prominent purveyor of anti-vaxxer ideology" and "the face of the anti-vaxx movement". Although she disputes the anti-vaccine label and has said she prefers the term "pro-safe-vaccine-schedule", this self-description has been met with strong criticism.
