Stevie is a 1978 British biographical film directed by Robert Enders, and starring Glenda Jackson, Trevor Howard, Mona Washbourne, and Alec McCowen. It was based on the play Stevie by Hugh Whitemore.Studios that distributed the film included 20th Century Fox in the U.S., Hoyts in Australia, and Universal Pictures internationally.
The film is about the life of the British poet Stevie Smith (played by Glenda Jackson), and centres on Smith's relationship with her aunt (Mona Washbourne), with whom she lived for many years in a house in Palmers Green, London.Film critic Roger Ebert wrote "It contains one of Glenda Jacksonâ€™s greatest performances. She knows this character well... She does what great actors can do: She takes a character who might seem uninteresting, and makes us care deeply about the uneventful days of her life."
