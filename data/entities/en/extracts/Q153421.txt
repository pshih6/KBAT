Konstantin Hermann Karl Freiherr von Neurath (2 February 1873 â€“ 14 August 1956) was a German diplomat who served as Foreign Minister of Germany between 1932 and 1938.
Born to a Swabian noble family, Neurath began his diplomatic career in 1901. He fought in World War I and was awarded the Iron Cross for his service. After the war, Neurath served as minister to Denmark, ambassador to Italy and ambassador to Britain. In 1932 he was appointed Foreign Minister by Chancellor Franz von Papen, and continued to hold the post under Adolf Hitler.
In the early years of the Nazi regime, Neurath was regarded as playing a key role in the foreign policy pursuits of Hitler in undermining the Treaty of Versailles and territorial expansion in the prelude to World War II, although he was often averse to Hitler's aims tactically if not necessarily ideologically. This aversion eventually induced Hitler to replace Neurath in 1938 with the more compliant and fervent Nazi Joachim von Ribbentrop. Neurath served as Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia between 1939 and 1943, though his authority was only nominal after September 1941.
Neurath was tried as a major war criminal in Nuremberg and sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment for his compliance and actions in the Nazi regime. He received an early release in 1954, after which he retired to his family estate and died two years later.
