Solomon Levey (1794â€“1833) was a convict transported to Australia in 1815 for theft who became a highly successful merchant and financier, at one time issuing his own banknotes in New South Wales. His success in New South Wales triggered the migration of many relatives. His brother Barnett was the first free Jewish settler. His brother Isaac was for a time President of the Sydney Hebrew Congregation. Solomon was a backer of the Swan River Colony in Western Australia, and lost a fortune when it failed. He was also a noted philanthropist.
Port Levy on Banks Peninsula, Canterbury New Zealand is named after him.
