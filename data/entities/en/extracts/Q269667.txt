Rheinfelden (Alemannic German: Rhyfälde, [ˈriːfæld̥ə]) is a municipality in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland, seat of the district of Rheinfelden.  It is located 15 kilometres east of Basel.  The name means the fields of the Rhine, as the town is located on the High Rhine.  It is home to Feldschlösschen, the most popular beer in Switzerland. The city is across the river from Rheinfelden in Baden-Württemberg; the two cities were joined until Napoleon Bonaparte fixed the Germany–Switzerland border on the Rhine in 1802 and are still socially and economically tied.
