Maxim Gavrilovich Rudometkin (Максим Гаврилович Рудомёткин) (Pronounced: Rudomyotkin) (c. 1818 – last seen in 1877) was a leader of a sect of Spiritual Christian Pryguny (Jumpers) (Russian: Прыгуны : Jumpers) called Maksimisti. 
In 1932, in Los Angeles his writings were collectively published with four other Prygun leaders as a Russian language religious text titled Kniga solntse, dukh i zhizn (Book of the Sun, Spirit and Life), placed next to the Russian Synodal Bible.
