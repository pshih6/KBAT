Michael Allen Jones (born November 18, 1981) is an American rapper, actor, songwriter, and entrepreneur. He reached national fame in 2004 on Swishahouse with the release of his breakout single "Still Tippin'", which peaked at number 60 on the Billboard Hot 100. Jones subsequently released his single "Back Then", which peaked at number 22 on the Billboard. "Still Tippin'" and "Back Then" acted as singles for his debut studio album Who Is Mike Jones?, released on April 19, 2005, which peaked at number 3 on the US Billboard 200 and is certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
Jones initially became recognized for his catchphrase "Mike Jones, who?" (or, "who is Mike Jones?"), which he would usually repeat several times on songs. He also became known for handing out shirts with his cell phone number printed on the back. The two went on to be trademarks of Jones throughout his music career.
