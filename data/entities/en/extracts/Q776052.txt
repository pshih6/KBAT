Tony Lo Bianco (born Anthony LoBianco; October 19, 1936) is an American film, stage, and television actor, known for his portrayals of gruff law enforcement figures in crime films. His accolades include one Tony Award nomination, an Obie Award, and a Daytime Emmy Award.
Born to first-generation Italian American parents in New York City, Lo Bianco began his career in theater, and appeared in several Broadway productions throughout the 1960s. He transitioned to film in the 1970s, starring in the crime film The Honeymoon Killers (1970), William Friedkin's thriller The French Connection (1971), and the drama The Seven-Ups (1973). Lo Bianco won an Obie Award for his 1975 role in an Off-Broadway production of Yanks-3, Detroit-0, Top of the Seventh, and subsequently earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor for his role as Eddie in the 1983 Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's A View from the Bridge.
In addition to film and theater, Lo Bianco appeared as a guest-star on numerous television series throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including appearances on Police Story (1974–1976), Franco Zeffirelli's miniseries Jesus of Nazareth (1977), and Marco Polo (1982). In 1984, he appeared in a stage production of Hizzoner!, playing American politician Fiorello LaGuardia. The one-man play was subsequently staged on Broadway in 1989, and Lo Bianco has gone on to perform several other Off-Broadway iterations of it, including LaGuardia (2008) and The Little Flower (2012–2015).
