Jozef Gašpar Tiso (Slovak pronunciation: [ˈjɔzɛf ˈtisɔ]; 13 October 1887 – 18 April 1947) was a Slovak politician and Roman Catholic priest who was president of the Slovak Republic, a client state of Nazi Germany during World War II, from 1939 to 1945. In 1947, after the war, he was executed for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Bratislava.
Born in 1887 to Slovak parents in Bytča, then part of Austria-Hungary, Tiso studied several languages during his school career, including Hebrew and German. He was introduced to priesthood from an early age and helped combat local poverty and alcoholism in what is now Slovakia. He joined the Slovak People's Party (Slovenská ľudová strana) in 1918 and became party leader in 1938 following the death of Andrej Hlinka. Nazi Germany seized Czechoslovakia in 1938 and the Czech portion became the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. On 14 March 1939, Slovak Assembly in Bratislava unanimously adopted Law 1/1939 transforming autonomous Slovak Republic (that was until then part of Czechoslovakia) into an independent country. Jozef Tiso, who was already the Prime Minister of the autonomous Slovakia (under Czechoslovak laws), became the Slovak Republic's Prime Minister, and, in October 1939, he was elected its President.
Tiso collaborated with Germany in deportations of Jews, deporting many Slovak Jews to extermination and concentration camps in Germany and German-occupied Poland, while some Jews in Slovakia were murdered outright. Deportations were executed between 25 March 1942 until 20 October 1942. An anti-fascist partisan insurgency was waged, culminating in the Slovak National Uprising in summer 1944, which was suppressed by German military authorities with many of its leaders executed. Consequently, on 30 September 1944, deportations of Jews were renewed, with additional 13,500 deported.
When the Soviet Red Army overran the last parts of western Slovakia in April 1945, Tiso fled to Austria and then Germany where American troops arrested him and then had him extradited back to the reformed Czechoslovakia, where he was convicted of treason against the state, treason against the uprising and collaboration, and then executed by hanging in 1947 and buried in Bratislava. In 2008, his remains were buried in the canonical crypt of the Catholic Cathedral in Nitra, Slovakia.
