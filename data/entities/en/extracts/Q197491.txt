The Wolverine is a 2013 superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Wolverine. Distributed by 20th Century Fox, it is the sixth installment in the X-Men film series, the second installment in the trilogy of Wolverine films, a standalone sequel to X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) and a direct sequel to X-Men: The Last Stand (2006). Directed by James Mangold, from a screenplay written by Scott Frank and Mark Bomback, based on the 1982 limited series Wolverine by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, it stars Hugh Jackman as Logan / Wolverine, alongside Rila Fukushima, Hiroyuki Sanada, Famke Janssen, and Will Yun Lee. Following the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, Logan travels to Japan, where he engages an old acquaintance in a struggle that has lasting consequences. Stripped of his healing powers, Wolverine must battle deadly samurai while struggling with guilt over Jean Grey's death.
The film's development began in 2009 after the release of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Christopher McQuarrie was hired to write a screenplay for The Wolverine in August 2009. In October 2010, Darren Aronofsky was hired to direct the film. The project was delayed following Aronofsky's departure and the T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. In June 2011, Mangold was brought on board to replace Aronofsky. Bomback was then hired to rewrite the screenplay in September 2011. The supporting characters were cast in July 2012 with principal photography beginning at the end of the month around New South Wales before moving to Tokyo in August 2012 and back to New South Wales in October 2012. The film was converted to 3D in post-production.
The Wolverine was released on July 24, 2013, in various international markets and on July 26, 2013, in the United States. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its action sequences, performances (especially Jackman's) and thematic profundity, though some criticism was directed at the predictable story and climax. The film earned $414 million worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film in the series. A third film titled Logan was released on March 3, 2017.
