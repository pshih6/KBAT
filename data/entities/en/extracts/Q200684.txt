Dignity Health Sports Park, formerly Home Depot Center and StubHub Center, is a multiple-use sports complex located on the campus of California State University, Dominguez Hills in Carson, California, that consists of the 27,000-seat Dignity Health Sports Park Soccer Stadium, the Dignity Health Sports Park Tennis Stadium, a track and field facility and a velodrome: VELO Sports Center. It is approximately 14 miles (23 km) south of downtown Los Angeles and its primary tenant is the LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer (MLS). The stadium is also home to the Los Angeles Wildcats of the XFL, and LA Galaxy II of USL Championship. 
Opened in 2003, the $150 million complex was developed and is operated by the Anschutz Entertainment Group. With a seating capacity of 27,000, it is the largest soccer-specific stadium in the U.S. and the second-largest among its kind in MLS, after Toronto FC's BMO Field in Ontario, Canada. In addition to hosting LA Galaxy games since its opening, the stadium also served as the home of the now-defunct Chivas USA MLS team from 2005 to 2014.
The stadium was the temporary home of the Los Angeles Chargers from 2017 to 2019. It was the smallest NFL stadium over the course of those three seasons. While the Chargers played in the stadium, the facility was named ROKiT Field at StubHub Center; ROKiT's naming rights to the football field are part of a "multi-year" agreement.During its first decade, the stadium's sponsor was hardware retailer The Home Depot. In 2013, the title sponsor became the online ticket marketplace StubHub. In 2019, the name sponsor became healthcare provider Dignity Health.
