Bristol Grammar School (BGS) is a 4–18 mixed, independent day school in Bristol, England. It was founded in 1532 by Royal Charter for the teaching of 'good manners and literature', endowed by wealthy Bristol merchants Robert and Nicholas Thorne to educate the sons of the city's merchants and tradesmen. The school flourished in the early 20th century under headmaster Sir Cyril Norwood (1906–1916), embodying "the ideals and experiences of a leading public school". Norwood went on to serve as the master at Marlborough College and Harrow.
Bristol Grammar's headmaster, Jaideep Barot MA MSc, is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) and joined the school from Marlborough College in September 2018. The school was first cited in the Public Schools Year Book in 1907, and former headmaster John Mackay (1960–1975) served as the chairman of the HMC in 1970. Founded as an all-boys school, Bristol Grammar is now fully co-educational having first admitted girls in 1980. The school counts among its alumni prominent personalities including Nobel laureate Sir John Pople, former British ambassador to the US Lord Oliver Franks, and founder of Penguin Books Sir Allen Lane. It has educated members of both houses of the UK Parliament and has a strong legal tradition, having educated two present Lord Justices of Appeal (Sirs Rabinder Singh and Timothy Holroyde).
The school is divided into three sections: the Infants and Juniors (ages 4–11), the Senior School (ages 11–16) and Sixth Form (ages 16–18). The Infants and Juniors School was ranked in 2016 by The Good Schools Guide as one of the best value prep schools in the UK. The Senior School and Sixth Form rank academically amongst the best performing independent schools in South West England.
