Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri Castelli (Spanish pronunciation: [leoˈpoldo foɾtuˈnato ɣalˈtjeɾi kasˈteʎi]; 15 July 1926 –  12 January 2003) was an Argentine general and President of Argentina from 22 December 1981 to 18 June  1982, during the last military dictatorship (known officially as the National Reorganization Process). The death squad, 601 Intelligence Battalion, directly reported to him. He was removed from power soon after the Argentine defeat by British armed forces in the Falklands War, whose invasion he had ordered.
