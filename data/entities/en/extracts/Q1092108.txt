The Cimetière du Grand Jas (Grand Jas Cemetery) is located at 205 avenue de Grasse in Cannes on the French Riviera. The nine hectare terraced cemetery began operations in 1866 and is known for its landscaped architecture with rich floral decorations and statuary.
Its "English square", or Cimetière Anglais, is the final resting place for a number of English people who made Cannes their home. It is dominated by the statue of Henry Peter Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux who played a major role in building the city.  The cemetery contains one Commonwealth war grave, of a World War I officer of the King's Royal Rifle Corps.
