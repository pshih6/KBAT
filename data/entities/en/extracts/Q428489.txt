Curtain Call is a 1998 romantic comedy directed by Peter Yates, photographed by Sven Nykvist and edited by Hughes Winborne. It stars James Spader, Polly Walker, Michael Caine and Maggie Smith. The film was later re-released under the title It All Came True (not to be confused with the completely unrelated 1940 Humphrey Bogart film of the same name). It was to be Peter Yates' last film made for cinema, although in most markets it went directly to TV or home video.
