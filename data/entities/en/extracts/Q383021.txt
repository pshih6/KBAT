Affair in Trinidad is a 1952 American film noir directed by Vincent Sherman and starring Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford. It was produced by Hayworth's Beckworth Corporation and released by Columbia Pictures. It is notable as Hayworth's "comeback" film after four years away from Columbia, as a re-teaming of the Gilda (1946) co-stars, and for a fiery opening number danced barefoot by Hayworth to calypso music.  Hayworth's singing voice is dubbed by Jo Ann Greer, who later also sang for her in Miss Sadie Thompson and Pal Joey. The film's gross take at the box office exceeded Gilda's by one million dollars.
