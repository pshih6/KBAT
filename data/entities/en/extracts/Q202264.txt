Murders in the Rue Morgue is a 1932 American pre-Code horror film, based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story "The Murders in the Rue Morgue". Bela Lugosi, one year after his performance as Dracula, portrays a lunatic scientist who abducts women and injects them with blood from his ill-tempered caged ape.
This film was produced as a compensatory package for Lugosi and Florey after both were dropped from 1931's Frankenstein. Initially booked with a lower budget, the film's budget increased after the success Universal had with Frankenstein which led to additional scenes shot and re-shoots to be done in December 1931. On the films release it was not a huge financial success and received negative reviews from critics who commented variously on the acting and narrative.
