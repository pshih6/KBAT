Maike Kohl-Richter (born April 1964 in Siegen, née Richter) was the second wife of former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl from 2008 to 2017. She is controversial in Germany for her right-wing anti-immigrant views and support for Viktor Orbán, and for her public feud with Kohl's children and grandchildren. She has been accused of hijacking Kohl's legacy and "has been criticised by Mr Kohl’s own children for allegedly hero-worshipping the former chancellor and being obsessed" with him. She was criticized by German media, public figures and the Kohl family after Kohl's death.
