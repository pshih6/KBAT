In 1976, Theodore Sturgeon wrote that Lem was the most widely read science fiction writer in the world.

They are sometimes presented as fiction, but others are in the form of essays or philosophical books.
Translating his works is difficult due to passages with elaborate word formation, idiomatic wordplay, alien or robotic poetry, and puns.
