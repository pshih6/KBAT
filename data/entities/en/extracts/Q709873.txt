Joseph Rudolph "Philly Joe" Jones (July 15, 1923 â€“ August 30, 1985) was an American jazz drummer, known as the drummer for the first "Great" Miles Davis Quintet. He should not be confused  with "Papa" Jo Jones, another drummer who had a long tenure with Count Basie. The two men died only a few days apart.
