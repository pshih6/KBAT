Moshé Pinchas Feldenkrais (Hebrew: משה פנחס פלדנקרייז‎, May 6, 1904 – July 1, 1984) was a Ukrainian-Israeli engineer and physicist, known as the founder of the Feldenkrais Method, a system of physical exercise that aims to improve human functioning by increasing self-awareness through movement.
One study has found the technique to be effective but another has found no evidence of health benefits. Feldenkrais' theory is that "thought, feeling, perception and movement are closely interrelated and influence each other."
