Piz Umbrail (3,033 m) is a mountain of the Ortler Alps, south of the Umbrail Pass (2,503 m), located on the border between Lombardy (Italy) and Graub√ºnden (Switzerland).
The mountain surface is partly of rubble and partly covered by grass, and therefore of little interest to mountaineers, but its proximity to the Umbrail Pass and accessible surface make it a popular destination for other visitors. In winter it is a relatively easy destination for ski-mountaineers.
