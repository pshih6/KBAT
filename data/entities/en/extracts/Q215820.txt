Anna Judith Gertrud Helene Kerr  (surname pronounced  KAR German pronunciation: [kɛʁ]; 14 June 1923 – 22 May 2019) was a German-born British writer and illustrator whose books sold more than 10 million copies around the world. She created both enduring picture books such as the Mog series and The Tiger Who Came to Tea and acclaimed novels for older children such as the semi-autobiographical When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit, which gave a child's-eye view of the Second World War. Born in the Weimar Republic, of Jewish background, she came to Britain with her family in 1933 during the rise of the Nazis.
