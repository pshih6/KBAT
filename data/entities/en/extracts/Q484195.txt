The Timurid Empire (Persian: تیموریان‎, romanized: Timuriyān), self-designated as Gurkani (Persian: گورکانیان‎, romanized: Gurkāniyān, lit. '"son-in-law" of Genghisids' ), was a Persianate Turco-Mongol empire comprising modern-day Uzbekistan, Iran, the southern Caucasus, Mesopotamia, Afghanistan, much of Central Asia, as well as parts of contemporary India, Pakistan, Syria and Turkey.
The empire was founded by Timur (also known as Tamerlane), a warlord of Turco-Mongol lineage, who established the empire between 1370 and his death in 1405. He envisioned himself as the great restorer of the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan, regarded himself as Genghis's heir, and associated much with the Borjigin. Timur continued vigorous trade relations with Ming China and the Golden Horde, with Chinese diplomats like Ma Huan and Chen Cheng regularly traveling west to Samarkand to collect tribute and sell goods, continuing Mongol empire tradition. The empire waved the Timurid Renaissance, particularly during the reign of astronomer and mathematician Ulugh Begh.
In 1467, the ruling Timurid dynasty, or Timurids, lost most of Persia to Azerbaijanis and the Aq Qoyunlu confederation. But members of the Timurid dynasty continued to rule smaller states, sometimes known as Timurid emirates, in Central Asia and parts of India. In the 16th century, Babur, a Timurid prince from Ferghana (modern Uzbekistan), invaded Kabulistan (modern Afghanistan) and established a small kingdom there, and from there 20 years later he invaded India to establish the Mughal Empire. Babur also claimed descent from Genghis Khan.
