Mário Lino Soares Correia (born May 31, 1940 in Lisbon), commonly known as Mário Lino, is a Portuguese civil engineer and former politician. He was the Minister of Public Works, Transportation and Communication in the 17th Constitutional Government of Portugal.
He became famous for saying that the southern waterfront of the Tagus river in Portugal "is a desert". Lino is a former member of the Communist Party.
He is also known for saying that the new Lisbon International Airport would never be constructed in the city of Alcochete, by using the expression "Na margem sul jamais!" ("in the south bank never!"), however later it was decided that the new airport would be built there.
These events led to accusations by the government's opposition that Mario Lino does not know what he is doing while taking decisions that may compromise the country.
He is also a supporter of Iberian Federalism.
After leaving the government, he largely withdrew from public life.
