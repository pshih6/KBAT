The Troyekurovo Cemetery (Russian: Троекуровское кладбище, romanized: Troyekurovskoye Cemetery), alternatively known as Novo-Kuntsevo Cemetery (Russian: Ново-Кунцевское кладбище, romanized: Novo-Kuntsevskoye Cemetery), is a cemetery in Moscow, Russia.
The cemetery is located in the former village of Troyekurovo on the western edge of Moscow, which derives its name from the Troyekurov princely family, a branch of the Rurikid House of Yaroslavl, that owned the village in the 17th century. Troyekurovo Cemetery Cemetery includes the Church of Saint Nicholas, built by Prince Troyekurov in 1699-1704, which was closed during the Soviet era but reopened in 1991.
Troyekurovo Cemetery is administered as a branch of the Novodevichy Cemetery and is the resting place of numerous notable Russian and Soviet figures.
