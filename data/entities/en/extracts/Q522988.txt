Alan Victor White (born 26 May 1972) is an English rock drummer, best known as being the drummer of the English rock band Oasis from 1995 to 2004. Before Oasis, he was the drummer of Starclub from 1991 to 1994. He is the longest serving drummer in Oasis's history, performing on four studio albums and one song on Dont Believe The Truth, two compilation albums and one live album during his tenure. He joined the band in May 1995 after the band's original drummer Tony McCarroll was removed from the band. He was recommended to Noel Gallagher by Gallagher's friend Paul Weller. Notably, Alan's brother Steve has been longtime drummer for Weller. White left Oasis in early 2004 in somewhat unclear circumstances. He was replaced by Zak Starkey, drummer of the Who and son of the Beatles' drummer Ringo Starr.
