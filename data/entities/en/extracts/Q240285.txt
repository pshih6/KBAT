Wonderwall is a 1968 psychedelic film by first-time director Joe Massot that stars Jane Birkin, Jack MacGowran, and Iain Quarrier, and features Richard Wattis and Irene Handl, and a cameo by Dutch collective The Fool, who were also set designers for the film.
The film is also remembered for its soundtrack, composed by then-Beatle George Harrison.
