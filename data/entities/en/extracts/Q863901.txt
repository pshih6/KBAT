Kacem El Ghazzali (Berber languages: ⵇⴰⵙⵎ ⵍⵖⴰⵣⴰⵍⵉ, Arabic: قاسم الغزالي‎), (born 24 June 1990), is a secularist writer and activist and is one of the few Moroccans to publicly announce to be an atheist. Kacem speaks English, as well as German, French, Arabic and Berber.

His articles have been published in/by the Richard Dawkins Foundation, Huffington Post, Le Monde, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Basler Zeitung and others.
In 2017 El Ghazzali was granted Swiss citizenship, and was chosen as one of the 14 most influential Swiss intellectuals of the year by the Basler Zeitung.
