Yun Chi-ho (Korean: 윤치호, hanja: 尹致昊, 1864 – 1945) was an important political activist and thinker during the late 1800s and early 1900s in Joseon Korea. His penname was Jwa-ong (좌옹, 佐翁); his courtesy name was Sungheum (성흠;聖欽), or Sungheum (성흠;成欽). Yun was a prominent member of reformist organizations such as the Independence Club (독립협회;獨立協會), led by Seo Jae-pil, the People's Joint Association (만민공동회;萬民共同會), and the Shinminhwae (신민회;新民會). He was a strong nationalist especially in his early years; pushing for reform and modernization of the Joseon government. He also served in various government positions and was a strong supporter of Christianity in Korea.Although Yun's early years were filled with strong support of patriotic and nationalist movements, there seemed to have been a change in Yun's approach to Korean independence in the wake of the Japanese dominance in Korea, starting with Korea becoming a protectorate of Japan in 1905, and then fully annexed into the Japanese Empire in 1910. Because of Yun's apparent change in attitude toward Korean independence and his lack of support of nationalist movements, like the 1919 Samil Movement, many Koreans today see him as a collaborator with the Japanese.Yun Chi-ho was a member of one of the prominent yangban families of Korea. Son of General Yun Ung-nyeol, who served as a minister in the Joseon government. he attended Vanderbilt University in Tennessee before transferring to Emory University in Georgia. He was also an early leader of the Korean YMCA and a South Korean Methodist.
