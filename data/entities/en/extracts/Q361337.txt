Adolf Edgar Licho (1876â€“1944) was a Russian-German actor, screenwriter, and film director. He was born of Jewish parentage in Kremenchug which was then part of the Russian Empire, but emigrated to Germany to work in the theatre and then later in silent films. Following the Nazi Party's takeover in 1933 he went into exile, first in Austria and France and later in the United States. In Hollywood he played minor roles until his death in 1944.
