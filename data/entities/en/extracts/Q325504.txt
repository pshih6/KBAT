Electronic rock is a music genre that involves a combination of rock music and electronic music, featuring instruments typically found within both genres. It originates from the late 1960s, when rock bands such as the United States of America, White Noise, and Gong began incorporating electronic instrumentation into rock music. Other early acts to blend synthesizers and musique concr√®te's tape music techniques with rock instrumentation included Silver Apples, Fifty Foot Hose, Syrinx, Lothar and the Hand People, Beaver & Krause and Tonto's Expanding Head Band. Many such 1960s acts blended psychedelic rock with avant-garde academic or underground influences.In the 1970s, German "krautrock" bands such as Neu!, Kraftwerk, Can, and Ash Ra Tempel challenged rock boundaries by incorporating electronic instrumentation. Since the late 2000s, electronic rock has become increasingly popular. Electronic rock acts usually fuse elements from other music styles, including punk rock, industrial rock, hip hop, techno, and synth-pop, which has helped spur subgenres such as indietronica, dance-punk, and electroclash.
