Kenny Morris (born Kenneth Ian Morris; 1 February 1957) was the first studio drummer of Siouxsie and the Banshees. He joined the band in January 1977.  His very first studio recording was in November 1977 when the band recorded their first John Peel session for BBC radio.
He played mostly toms. He influenced several drummers of the post-punk era including Stephen Morris of Joy Division, Kevin Haskins of Bauhaus, and  Paul Ferguson of Killing Joke.During the recording of the band's debut single "Hong Kong Garden", producer Steve Lillywhite suggested him to not record all the drums at the same time. Morris did the bass drum and the snare drum first. Then he did the cymbals and the tom-toms later. Lillywhite also added echo on the drums, adding significant space to the entire recording. NME wrote that this Lillywhite's work with Morris "revolutionis[ed] the post-punk band's sound with an innovative approach to laying down the drums".Morris played on the albums The Scream and Join Hands and left the band in September 1979.
