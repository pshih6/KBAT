√Ångel Faretta (born 21 April 1953) is an Argentine author of his own theory of cinema, film critic, writer, poet and teacher. Since 1980, he has been published in various media, testing, analysis articles and reviews on art, literature and cinema. For many followers of his theory he is "the person who most reflected on the cinema in Argentina, and its theoretical more lucid, original and influential, true to his thinking and away from any fashion." About Faretta, the film critic Fernando Regueira wrote:

"Faretta is the only thinker with a Theory of Cinema (Aesthetics and general) in our own homeland, and we fear much in our Spanish language throughout."
