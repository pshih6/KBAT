Antoni Canals (1352-1419) was a Dominican friar, orator and writer. He was born in the Kingdom of Valencia and he was famous for his sermons (even though unfortunately none of them has arrived to us) and by three translations or adaptations of classical works into Catalan.
He was disciple of Saint Vincent Ferrer, he taught theology in Valencia until 1398 and he was linked to the Royal Court, where he remained from 1398 until 1401, when he moved to Barcelona. When he came back to Valencia, he became the lieutenant of the kingdom's inquisitor from 1401 to 1419, when he died.
