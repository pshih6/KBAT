2PM (Korean: 투피엠) is a South Korean boy band formed by JYP Entertainment. The current members are Jun. K (formerly known as Junsu), Nichkhun, Taecyeon, Wooyoung, Junho and Chansung. Former leader Jaebeom officially left the band in early 2010.
The history of 2PM started when Korean musician Park Jin-young formed an eleven-member band known as One Day. Eventually the band was split into 2PM and a similar but independent group known as 2AM. 2PM debuted with the song "10 Jeom Manjeome 10 Jeom" (10점 만점에 10점, lit. "10 Points Out of 10 Points"), which showcased their acrobatic dance styles. They achieved their first number 1 single with "Again & Again". Both singles featured on their first studio album, 01:59PM, released in 2009. The band went on to release another Korean album, known as Hands Up, in 2011. They made their Japanese debut later that year with Republic of 2PM. After more than a year, the group returned in 2013 with their third studio album Grown. In early September 2014, 2PM returned with their fourth studio album Go Crazy. On 15 June 2015, 2PM made a comeback with their fifth studio album No.5. After much anticipation 2PM returned on 13 September 2016 with their sixth studio album Gentlemen's Game.
Since July 2017, the group has been on an official hiatus.
