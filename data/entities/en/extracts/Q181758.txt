Alejandro Cao de Benós de Les y Pérez (born 1974) is a Spanish-North Korean political activist with close relations with North Korea. He is a Special Representative of the Foreign Ministry of North Korea. He is, according to himself, also the Special Delegate of North Korea's Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
He is also the founder, president, and only salaried member of the Korean Friendship Association (KFA). All official government  and ministerial sites of North Korea have the .kp domain and – given the whois record for KFA's website points towards it being the personally owned domain of Cao de Benós – there is doubt about its claim to be the "official web page of DPR of Korea" and thus Cao de Benós's claims of his actual status in North Korea's hierarchy.He has been an advocate of North Korea since 1990. His Korean name, Cho Son-il ("Korea is One"), is self-given but not a legal name as he travels using his Spanish passport. He is an honorary member of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea and the Korean People's Army. He has lived in Tarragona and Barcelona (Spain), working as an IT consultant.On 14 June 2016, he was arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in Tarragona for arms trafficking.
