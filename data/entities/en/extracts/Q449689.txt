He replaced Secretary Paul O'Neill on February 3, 2003 and was succeeded by Henry Paulson on July 3, 2006, in a move that had been anticipated. Snow submitted a letter of resignation on May 30, 2006, effective "after an orderly transition period for my successor."

Snow is currently the Chairman of Cerberus Capital Management.
