Alfred Müller-Armack (28 June 1901 – 16 March 1978) was a German economist and politician.
He was professor of economics at University of Münster and University of Cologne. Müller-Armack coined the term "social market economy" in 1946.
Müller-Armack was a central figure of the "Cologne school". He always pointed out that the economy had to serve humanity. A regulatory environment should provide the basis for a form of competition that was to the best for all people.
In 1933 he published a book in praise of Nazism, entitled Ideas of the State and Economy Order in the New Reich. He worked as an advisor to the Nazi regime and the German army, and contributed to discussions about the post-war economic order.

After 1952, he worked in the economic ministry under Ludwig Erhard (CDU) as section chief of the newly founded policy department (Grundsatzabteilung).
