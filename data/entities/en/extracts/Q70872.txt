Paul Levi (11 March 1883 â€“ 9 February 1930) was a German Communist and Social Democratic political leader. He was the head of the Communist Party of Germany following the assassination of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht in 1919. After being expelled for publicly criticising Communist Party tactics during the March Action, he formed the Communist Working Organisation (KAG / Kommunistische Arbeitsgemeinschaft) which in 1922 merged with the Independent Social Democratic Party.  This party, in turn, merged with the Social Democratic Party a few months later and Levi became one of the leaders of its left wing.
