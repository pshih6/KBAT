Inspector Gadget is a science fiction comedy animated series co-created by Bruno Bianchi, Andy Heyward, and DIC's founder Jean Chalopin, and was originally syndicated by DIC Audiovisuel and Lexington Broadcast Services Company. The series stars the voice of Don Adams as the titular character, and first premiered on September 12, 1983. It is the first cartoon show to be syndicated by DIC, who specifically created the series to help expand into the North American market, and the first animated series to be presented in stereo sound. The program originally ran from 1983 to 1986, broadcasting 86 episodes over two seasons, and remained in syndication into the late 1990s. The show revolves around the adventures of a clumsy, dim-witted detective named Inspector Gadget â€“ a cyborg human with various bionic gadgets built into his body - who is sent on missions to thwart plans by his nemesis Dr. Claw, the leader of an evil organization known as "M.A.D.", unknowingly being assisted by his niece Penny and their dog Brain.The TV series proved to be a success for DIC, not only encouraging the company to produce additional programs such as Heathcliff, but also helped launch the Inspector Gadget franchise, including additional animated series and two live action films, as well as a sequel in 2015. As of today, the rights to the series are owned by WildBrain through its in-name-only unit, Cookie Jar Entertainment.
