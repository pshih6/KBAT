Konrad VIII the Younger (Polish: Konrad VIII Młody; after 1397 – before 5 September 1444), was a Duke of Oleśnica, Koźle, half of Bytom and half of Ścinawa during 1416–1427 (with his brothers as co-rulers) and sole Duke of half of Ścinawa since 1427 until his death.
He was the fifth and youngest son of Konrad III the Old, Duke of Oleśnica, by his wife Judith. Like his four older brothers, at the baptism he received the name of Konrad, which was characteristic in this branch of the House of Piast.
