Charles Robert Ashbee (17 May 1863 â€“ 23 May 1942) was a British architect and designer who was a prime mover of the Arts and Crafts movement  that took its craft ethic from the works of John Ruskin and its co-operative structure from the socialism of William Morris.
Ashbee was defined by one source as "designer, architect, entrepreneur, and social reformer". His disciplines included metalwork, textile design, furniture, jewellery and other objects in the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts genres.
