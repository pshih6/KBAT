Until Death Do Us Part (Japanese: 死がふたりを分かつまで, Hepburn: Shi ga Futari wo Wakatsu made) is a Japanese manga series written by Hiroshi Takashige and illustrated by DOUBLE-S. Until Death Do Us Part began its serialization on Young Gangan's December 2005 issue and ran until November 20, 2015. The story centers around a young girl with strong precognitive abilities. Due to these abilities, she is held hostage by a Yakuza group looking to make a profit off of them. However, knowing what was to come, she spots a blind swordsman in the crowd and immediately recognizes him as her only way out. She hires him to protect her "until death do us part", and thus begins a long road of action-packed confrontations to keep the young girl safe and her abilities out of the hands of those who would exploit them.
