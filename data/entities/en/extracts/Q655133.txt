Treasure Island (Russian: Остров сокровищ, Ostrov sokrovishch) is a 1988 Soviet animated film in two parts  based on the novel with the same name by Robert Louis Stevenson. While the film combines traditional animation and live action, it does it in a very different way than the American film Who Framed Roger Rabbit (which was also filmed in 1988), by predominantly incorporating live action sequences as episodes into the movie, as opposed to having a relatively seamless filmed picture with a number of hand-drawn characters added into it.
The first part of the film was released in 1986 and the second in 1988, after which the two parts were always displayed together. The film attained a cult classic status practically immediately after release, even though it went directly to TV and never had a theatrical release.
The film won the following awards: Grand Prize in Minsk, 1987; Grand Prize in Kiev, 1989; 1st Prize on International Cinema Festival of Television films in Czechoslovakia.
An American version of this film called The Return to Treasure Island was released direct-to-video in 1992. This version of the film is 34 minutes shorter (episodes with living actors were completely removed) than the Russian version.
