Zdeněk Nejedlý (February 10, 1878 in Litomyšl, Bohemia – March 9, 1962 in Prague) was a Czech musicologist, music critic, author, and politician whose ideas dominated the cultural life of what is now the Czech Republic for most of the twentieth century.  Although he started out merely reviewing operas in Prague newspapers in 1901, by the interwar period his status had risen, guided primarily by socialist political views.  This combination of left wing politics and cultural leadership made him a central figure in the early years of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic after 1948, where he became the first Minister of Culture and Education.  In this position he was responsible for creating a statewide education curriculum, and was associated with the early 1950s expulsion of university professors.
