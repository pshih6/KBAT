The City Law School is one of the five schools of City, University of London. In 2001, the Inns of Court School of Law became part of City, and is now known as The City Law School. Until 1997, the ICSL had a monopoly on the provision of the Bar Vocational Course (BVC), now known as the Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC), the obligatory professional training for would-be barristers in England and Wales, before they commence pupillage.
The School is divided into two sections on two campuses. The academic instruction section is based in the Gloucester Building, next to the university's main campus on Northampton Square. It offers education at all levels of legal qualification, including a three-year undergraduate Bachelor of Laws (LLB) programme, a two-year Graduate Entry LLB degree programme, a one-year Masters of Law (LLM) and the Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL) course (formerly known as the Common Professional Examination). This latter programme enjoys a nationwide reputation as one of Britain's elite qualifying diploma courses for non-law graduates. The School also teaches the Legal Practice Course (LPC) for would-be solicitors. In 2007, it received the highest grading from the Law Society of England and Wales for its provision.
The professional instruction section, formerly the Inns of Court School of Law, is located at Gray's Inn near Holborn. This section administers the Bar Professional Training Course (formerly the Bar Vocational Course) for intending barristers and the Legal Practice Course for intending solicitors as well as several Master of Laws (LLM) masters programmes. The Legal Practice Course is the only one in London to be rated 'Excellent' by the Law Society.
Approximately 1500 students are enrolled at the City Law School each year.
