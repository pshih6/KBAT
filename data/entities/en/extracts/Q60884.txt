Günther Anders (born Günther Siegmund Stern; Breslau, 12 July 1902 – Vienna, 17 December 1992) was a German-Jewish philosopher, journalist, essayist and poet. 
Trained in the phenomenological tradition, he developed a philosophical anthropology for the age of technology, focusing on such themes as the effects of mass media on our emotional and ethical existence, the illogic of religion, the nuclear threat, the Shoah, and the question of being a philosopher. 
In 1992, shortly before his death, Günther Anders was awarded the Sigmund Freud Prize.
