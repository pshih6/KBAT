Julius Edgar Lilienfeld (April 18, 1882 â€“ August 28, 1963) an Austro-Hungarian, and later American (where he moved in 1921) physicist and electrical engineer, credited with the first patents on the field-effect transistor (FET) (1925) and electrolytic capacitor (1931).   Because of his failure to publish articles in learned journals and because high-purity semiconductor materials were not available yet, his FET patent never achieved fame, causing confusion for later inventors.
