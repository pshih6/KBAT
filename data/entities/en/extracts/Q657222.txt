Stevens Institute of Technology is a private research university in Hoboken, New Jersey. Incorporated in 1870, it is one of the oldest technological universities in the United States and was the first college in America solely dedicated to mechanical engineering. The campus encompasses Castle Point, the highest point in Hoboken, and several other buildings around the city.
Founded from an 1868 bequest from Edwin Augustus Stevens, enrollment at Stevens includes more than 5500 undergraduate and graduate students representing 47 states and 60 countries throughout Asia, Europe and Latin America.  The university is home to two national Centers of Excellence as designated by the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  Two members of the Stevens community, as alumni or faculty, have been awarded the Nobel Prize: Frederick Reines (class of 1939), in Physics, and Irving Langmuir (Chemistry faculty 1906â€“1909), in chemistry.
