Matthew Moore Hardy (born September 23, 1974) is an American professional wrestler currently signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW). He is best known for his time with WWE as one half of The Hardy Boyz tag team. He also had runs as a singles performer and has worked for various other promotions including Impact Wrestling (formerly Total Nonstop Action Wrestling; TNA) and Ring of Honor (ROH). 
With his real life brother Jeff, Hardy gained notoriety in WWF's tag team division during the 90's due to participation in tables, ladders, and chairs matches. As a tag team wrestler, he is a 14-time world tag team champion, having held six (WWF) World Tag Team Championships, three WWE (Raw) Tag Team Championships, one WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship, one ROH World Tag Team Championship, one WCW Tag Team Championship and two TNA World Tag Team Championships.Wrestling through three separate decades, Hardy has kept himself relevant through a variety of different gimmicks, character changes as well as his use of social media. In 2002, Hardy began a solo career in WWE and his subsequent "Version 1" persona was named Best Gimmick by Wrestling Observer Newsletter. Hardy's eccentric "Broken" gimmick, which he debuted in 2016, earned him multiple awards and praise from wrestling critics, including a second Best Gimmick award (in 2017, the character was renamed "Woken" within WWE). As a singles wrestler, Hardy is a three-time world champion, winning the TNA World Heavyweight Championship twice and the ECW Championship once.
