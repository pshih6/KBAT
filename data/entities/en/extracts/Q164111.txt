Farah Pahlavi (Persian: فرح پهلوی‎, née Farah Diba Persian: فرح دیبا‎; born 14 October 1938) is the widow of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and was the  Shahbanu (empress) of Iran.
Farah was born into a prosperous family, whose fortunes were diminished after her father's early death. While studying architecture in Paris, she was introduced to the Shah at the Iranian Embassy, and they were married in December 1959. The Shah's first two marriages had not produced a son, necessary for the succession, so there was great rejoicing at the birth of  Crown Prince Reza the following October. Farah was then free to pursue interests other than domestic duties, though she was not allowed a political role. She worked for many charities, and founded Iran's first American-style university, enabling more women to become students. She also facilitated the buying-back of Iranian antiquities from museums abroad.
By 1978, there were clear signs of impending revolution, and the Imperial couple left the country in January 1979 under a death sentence. For this reason, most countries were reluctant to harbour them, President Sadat’s Egypt being an exception. But the Shah's health was failing, and he died in July 1980. In widowhood, Farah has continued her charity work, dividing her time between Washington, D.C. and Paris.
