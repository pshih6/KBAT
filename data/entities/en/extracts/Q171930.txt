Yevno Fishelevich Azef (Russian: Евгений Филиппович (Евно Фишелевич) Азеф, also transliterated as Evno Azef, 1869–1918), was a Russian socialist revolutionary who was also a double agent and agent provocateur, working both as an organizer of assassinations for the Socialist-Revolutionary Party and a police spy for the Okhrana, the Imperial secret police. He rose in the ranks to become the leader of the party's terrorist branch, the SR Combat Organization, from 1904 to 1908.
After having been found out by the revolutionary Vladimir Burtsev in 1909, he fled to Germany where he died in 1918.
