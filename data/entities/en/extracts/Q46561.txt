Ahmet Mithat (1844 – December 28, 1912) was an Ottoman journalist, author, translator and publisher during the Tanzimat period. In his works, he was known as Ahmet Mithat Efendi, to distinguish him from the contemporary politician Midhat Pasha. Ahmet Mithat Efendi took his name from Ahmed Şefik Midhat Pasha, as he worked for a time as an official and newspaper editor in Midhat Pasha's Vilayet of the Danube.
Politically, his orientation was more conservative, compared to writers such as Namık Kemal. He was a prolific writer, more than 250 of his works have survived. From 1878 on, he published the newspaper Tercüman-ı Hakikat (Interpreter of Truth).
His editorship and publication of Olga Lebedeva's translations of Russian literature into Turkish served as an introduction of Tolstoy, Lermontov and Pushkin to Turkey's readership. In addition, he was a patron and teacher to Fatma Aliye, one of the most famous female Ottoman authors.
