Josep Irla i Bosch (Catalan pronunciation: [ʒuˈzɛp ˈiɾlə j ˈβɔsk]; 24 October 1874 – 19 September 1958) was a Catalan businessman and politician.
He was a deputy in the Parliament of Catalonia and the Spanish Congress in 1932, as an Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya affiliate. He was also the last President of Parliament of Catalonia at the end of Republican Catalan resistance in the Spanish Civil War, before Francisco Franco abolished the Generalitat of Catalonia. He was elected President of the Parliament of Catalonia on 1 October 1938.
In office, Irla pushed for cooperation with the allies, Basque nationalists and other anti-Francoist groups, though excluding the communists.
He became the President-in-exile of the Generalitat after Lluís Companys was executed.
During his time as President-in-exile, he established a Government in exile, and appointed Josep Tarradellas as Conseller en Cap (Prime Minister). He resigned as President in 1954.
