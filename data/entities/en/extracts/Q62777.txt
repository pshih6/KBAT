Christoph Gustav Ernst Ahl (1 September 1898 – 14 February 1945) was a German zoologist, born in Berlin.
He was the director of the department of ichthyology and herpetology in the Museum für Naturkunde.
He was also the editor in chief of the review Das Aquarium from 1927 to 1934.
During World War II, Ahl fought in the ranks of the Wehrmacht - in Poland, North Africa and later Yugoslavia. He was executed while in refuge in Yugoslavia, after the partisans found out he was a German.
He did one of the first studies on bearded dragons and determined what genus they belonged to.
Ahl is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of lizards: Anolis ahli and Emoia ahli.
