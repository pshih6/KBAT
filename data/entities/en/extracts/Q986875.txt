Chhoti Sadri is a town and a municipality in Pratapgarh district in the state of Rajasthan, India. It is situated near Neemuch on the Ajmer-Khandwa railway line.
This place was famous for a temple of Devi built in the 5th century  AD. This temple is now known as Bhavar Mata Ji just 3 km away from the center of the city. Initially known as the City of Gold (Swarna Nagari), Chhotisadri has been gradually developed in an urban area with a Panchayat Samiti and a Nagar Palika, though the city doesn't figure in the Indian Railways Map yet.
