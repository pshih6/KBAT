Scary Movie is a 2000 American parody slasher film directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans. The film spoofs multiple genres including the horror, slasher, and mystery film genres. Several 1990s films and TV shows are also spoofed, and the script primarily follows the plot of slasher films Scream (1996), and I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997).
Despite a mixed critical reception, the film has since attracted a large cult following, and was a box office success, grossing $278 million worldwide on a $19 million budget. The first in the Scary Movie film series, it was followed by four sequels.
