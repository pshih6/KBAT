Hans Ludwig David Paul, Graf Yorck von Wartenburg (1 April 1835 â€“ 12 September 1897) was a German lawyer, writer and philosopher.
 Graf (Count) Yorck developed a hermeneutical philosophy of history in exchange with his friend Wilhelm Dilthey. Their correspondence influenced the early Martin Heidegger's philosophy of history, especially central concepts of his early thought and Being and Time such as historicity, generation, and the difference between history as lived (Geschichte) and as an object of inquiry (Historie).
Yorck was a grandson of the Napoleonic-era field marshal Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg.
