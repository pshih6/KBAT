Philotheos Kokkinos (Thessaloniki, c. 1300 â€“ Constantinople, 1379) was the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople for three periods from November 1353 to 1354, 1354, and 1364 to 1376. He was appointed patriarch in 1353 by the emperor John VI Kantakouzenos, deposed by John V Palaiologos in 1354 and then restored by Patriarch Callistus I of Constantinople.  He was an anti-unionist who opposed Emperor John V in his intent to negotiate re-union of the churches with Popes 
Urban V and Gregory XI. He is commemorated on October 8.
