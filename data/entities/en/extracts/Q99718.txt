Hartmut Gründler  (11 January 1930 – 21 November 1977) was a German teacher from Tübingen, engaged in environmental protection, who  burned himself out of protest against the misinformation in the atomic policy of the German Federal Government at that time, which were documented by him, but officially never taken back, and the denial of the relevant dialogue with Federal Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
