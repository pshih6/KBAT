Siegfried Aufhäuser (1 January 1884, in Augsburg — 6 December 1969, in Berlin) was a German politician and union leader, and from 1921 to 1933, chairman of the largely white-collar AfA-Bund.
Aufhäuser joined the SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany) in 1912; after a brief period in the USPD (Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany), he served as an SPD Reichstag deputy from 1921 to 1933.  Arrested several times in 1933, he emigrated the same year.  Until 1935 he belonged to the executive committee of the SPD-in-exile, then strongly rejected the party's reformist course, viewing resistance to Hitler from a standpoint of class struggle.  After 1939, Aufhäuser lived in New York City as a journalist.  In 1951 he returned to Germany, where he was chairman of the German Salaried Employees' Union (German: Deutsche Angestellten-Gewerkschaft; DAG).
