Gustaf Kossinna (28 September 1858 â€“ 20 December 1931) was a German philologist and archaeologist who was Professor of German Archaeology at the University of Berlin. 
Along with Carl Schuchhardt he was the most influential German prehistorian of his day, and was creator of the techniques of settlement archaeology (German: Siedlungsarchaeologie). His nationalistic theories about the origins of the Germanic peoples and Indo-Europeans influenced aspects of Nazi ideology. For this reason, Kossinna has often been referred to as the evil mastermind who built the ideological foundations for Nazism. Though politically discredited after World War II, Kossinna's methodological approach has greatly influenced archaeology up to the present day.In the years following World War II, Kossinna's theories of settlement archaeology were widely dismissed as pseudoscience. In June 2015, two ground-breaking archaeogenetic studies appeared to confirm certain key aspects of Kossinna's theories on settlement archaeology and Indo-European migrations, in what has been referred to as Kossinna's Smile. The apparent validation of Kossinna's theories at the expense of post-World War II theories have sparked intense controversy and anxiety in the archaeological community.
