Christel Wegner (born November 16, 1947 in Hamburg) is a German Communist politician.  In 2008, she was elected to the assembly of Lower Saxony for Die Linke, although she is a member of the German Communist Party (DKP), which until now has cooperated closely with that party. Shortly after her election, she gained widespread attention when it was claimed by a TV program that she had called for the return of the Stasi and justified the construction of the Berlin Wall, also voicing her support for Margot Honecker. The Left party distanced itself from her and on February 18, 2008 she was expelled from The Left Party parliamentary group.
