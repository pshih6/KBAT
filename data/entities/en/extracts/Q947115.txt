Monroe (historically French: Poste-du-Ouachita) is the eighth-largest city in the U.S. state of Louisiana. It is the parish seat of Ouachita Parish. In the official 2010 census, Monroe had a population of 48,815. The municipal population declined by 8.1 percent over the past decade; it was 53,107 in the 2000 census. After a recheck in 2018, the Census Bureau changed the 2010 population from 48,815 to 47,877. Mayor Jamie Mayo, however, maintains that the Monroe population is more than 50,000 and indicated that he  will pursue a continued challenge to the count.
