Anti- is an American record label founded in 1999 as a sister label to Epitaph. While Epitaph's focus has mostly been on punk rock, Anti-'s roster includes country (Merle Haggard), hip hop (Sage Francis, The Coup), reggae (Buju Banton, Michael Franti), soul (Bettye LaVette, Doe Paoro), post-metal (Deafheaven), indie folk (The Swell Season, Saintseneca), rap rock (One Day as a Lion), indie rock (The Dream Syndicate, Islands, Japandroids) and Tom Waits.
Founded by Andy Kaulkin, Anti- first gained attention by releasing Tom Waits's Grammy Award-winning Mule Variations in 1999. Other veteran recording artists such as rhythm and blues singers Solomon Burke, Bettye LaVette and Marianne Faithfull have signed onto Anti- after leaving other labels.
