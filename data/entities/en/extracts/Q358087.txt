Micheal Ray Stevenson (born November 19, 1989), known by his stage name Tyga (a backronym for Thank you God always), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, actor, and television personality. After a number of independent releases, Tyga signed a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records and Republic Records in 2008. His major label debut Careless World: Rise of the Last King was released in 2011 and included the successful singles "Rack City", "Faded" featuring Lil Wayne, "Far Away" featuring Chris Richardson, "Still Got It" featuring Drake, and "Make It Nasty".
After disagreements with Young Money, Tyga's fourth album The Gold Album: 18th Dynasty was released independently on June 23, 2015 and became his worst selling album to that point, selling just 5000 equivalent album units in its first week.After a long period of poor sales and negative reviews from previous albums, his May 2018 single, "Taste" featuring Offset, peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100, being his first Top 40 single since "Ayo" with Chris Brown in 2015. That single would later serve as the lead single for his seventh album Legendary, which was eventually released in 2019.
