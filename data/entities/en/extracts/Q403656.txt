The Ganda people, or Baganda (endonym: Baganda; singular Muganda), are a Bantu ethnic group native to Buganda, a subnational kingdom within Uganda. Traditionally composed of 52 clans (although since a 1993 survey, only 46 are officially recognised), the Baganda are the largest ethnic group in Uganda, comprising 16.9 percent of the population.Sometimes described as "The King's Men" because of the importance of the king, or Kabaka, in their society, the Ganda number an estimated 5.6 million in Uganda. In addition, there is a significant diaspora abroad, with organised communities in Canada, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Traditionally, they speak Luganda.

		
		
		
		
Kabaka Mwanga II was Buganda's Last Powerful Kabaka. After his reign Buganda Kingdom's influence in the region was weakened significantly. Kabaka Mwanga II was betrayed by some of his Mengo confidants who collaborated with colonial British Bazungu to exile the Kabaka to Seychelles Islands where he later died as a loner. It was under these circumstances that Buganda Land was divided among regents and the British colonialist on behalf of the Queen of England.
