The Last Days of Pompeii is an Italian-American 1984 television miniseries filmed at Pinewood Studios and broadcast on ABC-TV and Rai, adapting the 1834 novel of the same name by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. It was the second English-language adaptation of the book for film or television (previously adapted mainly in Italian; the 1935 RKO film was unrelated to the novel and the 1900 adaptation by Walter R. Booth, the first adaptation to the cinema in English language, was a short film).
On June 5, 2012 Sony released the mini-series on DVD.
