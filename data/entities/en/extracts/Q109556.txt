She provided the German voice for actresses like Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny in the James Bond films and Barbara Bel Geddes as Miss Ellie Ewing from Dallas. She was also the German voice of Wilma in The Flintstones and voiced figures in Disney classics like Dumbo, Lady and the Tramp and One Hundred and One Dalmatians.
