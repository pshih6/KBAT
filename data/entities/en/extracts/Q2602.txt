Egon Rudi Ernst Krenz (German pronunciation: [ˈeːgɔn ˈkʁɛnts]; born 19 March 1937) is a former East German politician who was the last communist leader of East Germany during the final months of 1989. He succeeded Erich Honecker as the General Secretary of the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), but was forced to resign only months later when the Berlin Wall fell. He has been described as "East Germany's last dictator."Throughout his career, Krenz held a number of prominent positions in the SED. He was Honecker's deputy from 1984 onward, until he succeeded him in 1989 amid protests against the regime. Krenz was unsuccessful in his attempt to retain the communist regime's grip on power, and was forced to resign some weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall. He was expelled from the SED party on 21 January 1990. After German reunification in 1990, he was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison for manslaughter, for his role in the crimes of the communist regime. He retired to the small town of Dierhagen in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern upon his release from prison in late 2003. Since his release from prison he has expressed his support for Vladimir Putin.
