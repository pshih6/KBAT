Dead like Me: Life After Death is a 2009 American fantasy comedy-drama film directed by Stephen Herek and written by John Masius and Stephen Godchaux, based on the short-lived 2003 television series Dead Like Me, created by Bryan Fuller.
Following the end of the series, the "reapers" have a new boss, Kane, who leads them astray from the rules they followed (mostly) in the TV series. Lead character "George" is fired from her job at Happy Time and ends up revealing her identity to her sister, Reggie. George's fellow reapers confront Kane and find that he knows and does not care that their departure from the job rules is causing misfortune elsewhere. Unhappy with his leadership, they try various ways to end his existence. George gets her Happy Time job back, and the reapers await a new boss.
Laura Harris was unavailable to return as Daisy Adair, and Sarah Wynter replaced her. The rest of the returning cast reprised their roles, with new character Cameron Kane played by Henry Ian Cusick. The film was released on DVD on February 17, 2009, after a month-prior debut on Canada's Super Channel.
