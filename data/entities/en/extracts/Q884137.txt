Blind Illusion is an American progressive thrash metal band from Richmond, California, United States. Formed in 1978 by lead guitarist and main songwriter Marc Biedermann, the band had an extremely unstable lineup (Biedermann being the only constant member) and went through several stylistic changes during their time. After a 20-year hiatus, Biedermann reformed Blind Illusion in 2009. Blind Illusion released a new EP almost a full length album entitled 2018 (released in the same year). The album includes two remakes of The Sane Asylum more popular songs.
