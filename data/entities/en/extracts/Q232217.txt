Two or Three Things I Know About Her (French: Deux ou Trois choses que je sais d'elle) is a 1967 French New Wave film directed by Jean-Luc Godard, one of three features he completed that year. Like the other two (Week End and La Chinoise), it is considered both socially and stylistically radical. Village Voice critic Amy Taubin considers it one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking.
