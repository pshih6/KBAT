Sir Henry Morton Stanley  (born John Rowlands; 28 January 1841 –  10 May 1904) was a Welsh journalist and explorer who was famous for his exploration of central Africa and his search for missionary and explorer David Livingstone. Upon finding Livingstone, Stanley claimed to have delivered the now-famous line: "Dr Livingstone, I presume?" However, as this line does not appear in his journal from the time and—with the two pages directly following the recording of his initial spotting of Livingstone having been torn out of the journal at some point—it is most likely that Stanley simply embellished the pithy line sometime afterwards. Additionally, Livingstone himself never mentioned it and tended to instead recount, about their first encounter, the reaction of Stanley's servant, Susi, who cried out: "An Englishman coming! I see him!"Stanley is mainly known for his search for the source of the Nile, work he undertook as an agent of King Leopold II of Belgium, which enabled the occupation of the Congo Basin region, in addition to his command of the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition. He was knighted in 1899.
