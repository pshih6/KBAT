Shaikh Abu al-Faiz ibn Mubarak, popularly known by his pen-name, Faizi (20 September 1547 â€“ 15 October 1595) was a poet and scholar of late medieval India whose ancestors hailed from Yemen. In 1588, he became the Malik-ush-Shu'ara (poet laureate) of Akbar's Court. He was the elder brother of Akbar's historian Abul Fazl. Akbar highly recognised the genius in him and appointed him tutor for his sons and gave place to him among his decorative 'Navaratnas'.
