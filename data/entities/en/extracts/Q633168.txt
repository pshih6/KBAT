Archibald Gracie IV (January 15, 1858 â€“ December 4, 1912) was an American writer, soldier, amateur historian, real estate investor, and survivor of the sinking of RMS Titanic. He survived the sinking by climbing aboard an overturned collapsible lifeboat and wrote a popular book about the disaster, which is still in print today. He never recovered from his ordeal and died less than eight months after the sinking, becoming the first adult survivor to die.
