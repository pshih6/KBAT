Boris Khristoforovich Parsadanian (Russian: Борис Христофорович Парсаданян; 14 May 1925, in Kislovodsk – 14 May 1997, in Tallinn) was an Armenian-Estonian composer.
Born in Kislovodsk, Russia, his initial studies were conducted under Litinsky at the Studio of the Armenian House of Culture. His studies were interrupted by World War II, for which he was decorated for his service. He resumed his post-war studies as a violin student at the Gnessin School in Moscow until his graduation in 1950.
After graduation, he moved to Estonia, initially obtaining a post in the Tallinn Radio Orchestra, then later deciding to focus on composing. He entered the conservatory at Tallinn, studying composition under Heino Eller.
Parsadanian became an "adopted" Estonian, residing there until his death. He wrote all of his major works while living in Estonia, and eventually received the distinction of Honoured Artist of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic.
His compositions include eleven symphonies composed between 1958 and 1987, the second of them a tribute to Martiros Saryan; a violin concerto (1955), a wind quintet (1967), a string quartet (1974), a violin sonata (1986) and other music.
