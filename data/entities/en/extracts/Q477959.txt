Shaun the Sheep is a British stop-motion animated television series spin-off of the Wallace and Gromit franchise.  The series stars Shaun — a sheep previously featured in the 1995 short film A Close Shave and in the Shopper 13 short film from the 2002 Wallace and Gromit's Cracking Contraptions series — and his madcap adventures around a small farm as the leader of his flock.
The series was first aired in the UK on the CBBC block on BBC One on 5 March 2007. It has been broadcast in 180 countries globally. The series consists of 150 seven-minute episodes. The fifth series contains 20 episodes and was aired in the Netherlands from 1 December 2015 until 1 January 2016 and in Australia on ABC Kids from 16 January 2016 until 1 May 2016.
The series inspired its own spin-off, Timmy Time, which follows the adventures of Shaun's small cousin and is aimed at younger viewers. A feature-length film, titled Shaun the Sheep Movie, was released theatrically in 2015. A 30-minute film, titled Shaun the Sheep: The Farmer's Llamas, was aired as a 2015 Christmas TV special. The second feature-length film, titled A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon, was released theatrically on 18 October 2019.
The series recently has migrated to Netflix for a sixth series, under the subtitle Adventures from Mossy Bottom.
