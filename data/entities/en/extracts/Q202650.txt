Abd el-Krim el-Khattabi (Arabic: محمد بن عبد الكريم الخطابي‎) (1882, Ajdir – 6 February 1963, Cairo) was a Moroccan political and military leader. He and his brother Mhemmed led a large-scale revolt by a coalition of Berber-speaking Rif tribes against French and Spanish colonization of the Rif, in northern Morocco. The rebels established the short-lived Republic of the Rif. His guerrilla tactics influenced Ho Chi Minh, Mao Zedong and Che Guevara.
