Li Na (simplified Chinese: 李讷; traditional Chinese: 李訥; pinyin: Lĭ Nà or Li Ne, born August 1940), is the daughter of Mao Zedong and his fourth wife Jiang Qing, and their only child together. Her surname is Li rather than Mao, because her father used the pseudonym "Li Desheng" (李德胜; 李德勝) for a period of time during the Chinese Civil War.
The names of Li Na and her sister Li Min come from Book 4 of the Analects of Confucius: "ne yu yan er min yu xing" (讷于言而敏于行, meaning slow in speech and earnest in conduct).
