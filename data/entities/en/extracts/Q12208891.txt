Hamoud bin Abdulaziz al Saud (1947 â€“  26 February 1994) was the only child of Futaimah Al-Yamania and the youngest (not to die in his birthyear) and reportedly 36th son of Ibn Saud (the founder of Saudi Arabia) to live to adulthood. He is the only one not represented in the Allegiance Council originally (later joined in similar circumstances by Prince Fawwaz upon his death) because he died without sons, only having one daughter. Some sources say that he died in Saudi Arabia while talking with King Fahd. He was also sometimes threatened by his brothers because he was the youngest of all his siblings. He had a younger half-brother, Jiluwi (II), who was born in 1952, but died the same year. He was the youngest surviving son of Abdulaziz until his death in 1994, making Muqrin bin Abdulaziz the youngest surviving son of Ibn Saud.
