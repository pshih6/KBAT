Mario Brega (25 March 1923  â€“ 23 July 1994) was an Italian actor. His heavy build meant that he regularly portrayed a thug in his films, particularly earlier in his career in westerns. Later in his career, however, he featured in numerous Italian comedy films. Brega stood at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) and well over 250 pounds (110 kg) at his heaviest but after the 1960s slimmed down significantly.
