Patrick Joseph Kenny (born 17 May 1978) is a professional footballer who plays for Maltby Main.
Born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, Kenny began his career with Bradford Park Avenue before turning professional in the summer of 1998 upon signing for Neil Warnock's Bury. He was reunited with Warnock in 2002 after he joined Sheffield United where he spent much of his career and enjoyed notable success; performing in League Cup and FA Cup semi-finals, two play-off finals, and then promotion to the Premier League in 2005â€“06.
Kenny would later sign for Warnock once again in 2010, joining Queens Park Rangers after his time at Sheffield United ended on a sour note when he spent much of his final season on the sidelines having failing a drugs test the previous summer. During his first season at QPR he would achieve his second promotion to the Premier League and his first Championship winners medal. He remained as first choice goalkeeper the next season as QPR beat relegation on the final day of the season, before he was reunited with Warnock for the fourth time when he signed for Leeds United in 2012. He stayed at Leeds for two years, before brief spells with Bolton Wanderers, Oldham Athletic (on loan), Ipswich Town, Bury, and Rotherham United.
