Sciences Po is commonly ranked as one of the best universities for political science and international studies in the world.It was founded in 1872 to promote a new class of French politicians in the aftermath of the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. The school's alumni include many prominent figures of the French and international political elite. Seven recent French presidents, 13 French prime ministers, 12 foreign heads of state or government, and six of the CEOs of France's largest companies have studied at Sciences Po.Sciences Po undertook a substantial reform agenda starting in the mid-1990s, which broadened its focus to prepare students for the private sector, put an emphasis on the internationalization of the school's curriculum and student body, and established a special admission process for underprivileged applicants. Sciences Po also expanded outside Paris by establishing additional campuses in Dijon, Le Havre, Menton, Nancy, Poitiers, and Reims. The Sciences Po curriculum now incorporates core courses in various branches of the social sciences, such as law, economics, history, political science, and sociology. The institution is a member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs and the Global Public Policy Network.
