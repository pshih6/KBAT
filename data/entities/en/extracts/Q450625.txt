Alytus is a city with municipal rights in southern Lithuania. It is the capital of Alytus County. Its population in 2013 was 57,281. Alytus is the historical centre of the DzÅ«kija region. The city lies on the banks of the Nemunas River. The major roads linking Vilnius, Kaunas, Lazdijai (border with Poland), and Hrodna in Belarus pass through Alytus. 
Divided onto two separate entities for centuries, it consists of two parts still frequently referred to as Alytus I and Alytus II, the earlier being a smaller town and the latter forming the city centre with parks, microdistricts and industrial areas.
