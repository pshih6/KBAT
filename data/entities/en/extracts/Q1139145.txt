Transportes Aereos del Continente Americano, (Air Transports of the American Continent, simply known as TACA Airlines), operating as Avianca El Salvador, is an airline owned by the Synergy Group based in El Salvador.  As TACA, it was the flag carrier of El Salvador.  As Avianca El Salvador, it is one of the seven nationally branded airlines in the Avianca Holdings group of Latin American airlines, and has been in operation for 75 years.
TACA owned and operated five other airlines in Central America, and its name was originally an acronym meaning Transportes Aéreos Centroamericanos (Central American Air Transport), but this was changed to Transportes Aéreos del Continente Americano (Air Transport of the American Continent), reflecting its expansion to North, Central, South America and the Caribbean.
On October 7, 2009, it was announced that TACA would merge with Avianca, though TACA maintained its name until the merger was officially completed on May 21, 2013.
TACA Airlines was the second-oldest continuously operating airline brand in Central America and the Caribbean after Cubana de Aviación.
