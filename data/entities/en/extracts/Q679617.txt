Ödön Beniczky de Benice et Micsinye (12 February 1878 – 20 January 1931) was a Hungarian legitimist politician, who served as Interior Minister between 1919 and 1920. He was a resolute adversary of Governor Miklós Horthy. He supported the king Charles IV in the king's attempts to retake the throne of Hungary. That is why Beniczky was arrested for a short time. He published his statement before the military public prosecutor's department in his newspaper ("Az Újság") about the White Terror. He was also arrested for two years. Beniczky's case was a huge scandal in Hungary, but the legitimists didn't use these happenings against the governor.
After the prison Beniczky failed as representative candidate. He committed suicide in 1931.
