Garmin-Cervélo was an elite professional women's cycling team registered in Great Britain and racing on the UCI Women's Road World Cup circuit. The team was previously known was Cervélo-Lifeforce Pro Cycling Team, but in 2009, with the creation of the UCI Professional Continental team Cervélo TestTeam, the women's team changed names to match the men's team. When the men's Cervélo TestTeam merged with Garmin–Transitions for the 2011 season, the team changed names again, becoming Garmin-Cervélo to again match the men's team. In 2007, the team was known as Raleigh-Lifeforce-Creation and prior to 2007, the team was known as the Univega Pro Cycling Team.The Garmin-Cervélo women's team disbanded at the end of 2011 due to funding problems. Six of its ten riders, including all four Britons, transferred to the AA Drink-leontien.nl team for the 2012 season.
