Whity is a 1971 West German film, written and directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and starring GÃ¼nther Kaufmann and Hanna Schygulla. Shot in Spain, it is a melodrama in the form of a Spaghetti Western which addresses some of Fassbinder's recurrent themes such as dysfunctional families, sexual diversity and the struggle of the individual to find a place in society. Though entered into the 21st Berlin International Film Festival, it was never distributed theatrically and only much later achieved a DVD release.
