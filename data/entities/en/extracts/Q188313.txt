Blackburn had a population of 117,963 in 2011.A former mill town, textiles have been produced in Blackburn since the middle of the 13th century, when wool was woven in people's houses in the domestic system. Flemish weavers who settled in the area in the 14th century helped to develop the woollen cottage industry. The most rapid period of growth and development in Blackburn's history coincided with the industrialisation and expansion of textile manufacturing. Blackburn was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution and amongst the first industrialised towns in the world.Blackburn's textile sector fell into decline from the mid-20th century and subsequently faced similar challenges to other post-industrial northern towns, including deindustrialisation, economic deprivation and housing issues. The town has experienced very high levels of immigration, with people of ethnic backgrounds other than white British making up 30.8% of the population. Blackburn has had significant investment and redevelopment since 1958 through government funding and the European Regional Development Fund.
