Epameinondas Deligiorgis (Greek: Επαμεινώνδας Δεληγεώργης, pronounced [epamiˌnonðas ðeliʝiˈorʝis]; January 10, 1829, Tripoli, Arcadia – May 14, 1879, Athens) was a Greek lawyer, newspaper reporter and politician, who served as the 20th Prime Minister of Greece. He was the son of Demetrios Deligiorgis, a politician from Missolonghi who participated in the Greek War of Independence. Deligiorgis studied law at the University of Athens and entered politics in 1854. He was not a proponent of the Megali Idea (Great Idea) and thought that a better solution to the Eastern Question would be to improve the condition of the Greeks living in Ottoman-controlled Macedonia, Epirus, Thrace and Asia Minor by liberalising the Ottoman Empire. Deligiorgis was the person who, on October 10, 1862, declared the end of the reign of King Otto and the convening of a national assembly.
