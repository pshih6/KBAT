Moses ibn Tibbon (born in Marseille; flourished between 1240 and 1283) was a Jewish physician, author and translator in Provence. The number of works written by Moses ibn Tibbon suggest that he reached a great age.
He was the son of Samuel ibn Tibbon, a Jewish scholar and doctor who translated Maimonides into Hebrew.
Moses married and was the father of Judah ibn Tibbon, who was prominent in the Maimonidean controversy which took place at Montpellier, southern France. With other Jewish physicians of Provence, Moses was restricted by the order of the Council of BÃ©ziers (May 1246), which prohibited Jewish physicians from treating Gentiles.
