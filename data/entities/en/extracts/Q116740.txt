Alexander Joseph Sulkowski (Polish: Aleksander Józef Sułkowski; 15 March 1695 – 21 May 1762) was a Saxon-Polish general and the progenitor of the Sułkowski noble line.
The Kraków-born Sulkowski was a favorite companion of August III the Saxon, son of Polish King Augustus II the Strong, and his Minister of State in Saxony from 1733 to 1738. He was created a Count of the Holy Roman Empire in 1733, and elevated to the rank of Prince of Bielsko by Empress Maria Theresa of Austria in 1754. According to some sources, Alexander Joseph was an illegitimate son born to Elżbieta Szalewska from King Augustus II. Elżbieta's husband, Stanisław Sułkowski, gave Alexander Joseph his last name.
On 31 October 1728, Sulkowski married Baroness Marie Franciszka Frn von Stain zu Jettingen (2 February  1712 – 16 November  1741). They had eight children. In 1743, he married Css Anna Przebendowska (25 July 1721 – 1795), with whom he had four more children. Sulkowski died 21 May 1762, aged 67, in Leszno.
