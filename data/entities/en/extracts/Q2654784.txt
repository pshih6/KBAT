Louis Bamberger (15 May 1855 â€“ 11 March 1944) was the leading citizen of Newark, New Jersey, from the early 1900s until his death in 1944.  He is noted for co-founding (with his sister Caroline Bamberger Fuld) the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.  He was a businessman and philanthropist and at his death all flags in Newark were flown at half-staff for three days, and his large department store closed for a day.
