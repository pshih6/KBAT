Aurelius Ambrosius (c. 340–397), better known in English as Ambrose (), an Archbishop of Milan, became one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the 4th century. He served as the Roman governor of Liguria and  Emilia, headquartered in Milan, before popular acclamation propelled him into becoming Bishop of Milan in 374. Ambrose staunchly opposed Arianism.
Western Christianity identified Ambrose as one of its four traditional Doctors of the Church, and as the patron saint of Milan. He had notable influence on Augustine of Hippo (354-430).
Tradition credits Ambrose with promoting "antiphonal chant", a style of chanting in which one side of the choir responds alternately to the other, as well as with composing Veni redemptor gentium, an Advent hymn.
