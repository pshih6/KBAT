Georg Thomalla (14 February 1915 â€“ 25 August 1999) was a German actor. He appeared in about 150 film and television productions between 1939 and 2000, and was widely known in Germany for his comedic roles.
Thomalla was also well-known in Germany as a voice-over artist, dubbing particularly comedians, such as Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther movies, and he also was the standard German dubbing voice of Jack Lemmon from 1955 to 1998. Thomalla also dubbed Lemmon as the second musician in Some Like It Hot - interestingly, Thomalla had played the same role in the German comedy Fanfares of Love (1951), which served as a direct predecessor for Some Like It Hot. After Thomalla had dubbed Lemmon for more than 40 years, the two met at the 1996 Berlin International Film Festival where Thomalla held an honorific speech for Lemmon.
He was awarded the German Federal Cross of Merit in 1985.
