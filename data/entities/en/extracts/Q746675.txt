The Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary was a basilica in Székesfehérvár, (in Latin: Alba Regia) Hungary.

It was built in the late 1010s by Saint Stephen I, the first King of Hungary. The basilica was an impressive building, one of the greatest in Hungary. It was never episcopal, but it was used as the principal church of the rulers of Hungary.
It was the most significant place of the Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages, as it contained the crown jewels, including the throne, the Holy Crown of Hungary, the treasury and the archives. 37 kings and 39 queens were crowned in this basilica and 15 were buried in it. In 1543, the Turks occupied Székesfehérvár. The royal graves were ransacked and the basilica was used to store gunpowder while St. Martin's Cathedral in Pozsony became the new coronation site.
In 1601, the valuable building was destroyed by fire. During this time, the Ottoman rule of the city was interrupted for about one year.
Its ruins were demolished and used for the construction of the new episcopal residence and for the reconstruction of another old church which in the 18th century became the cathedral of the Diocese of Szekesfehervar, erected in 1777.
