La Fémis (French: École Nationale Supérieure des Métiers de l'Image et du Son, formerly known as the Institut des hautes études cinématographiques, IDHEC) is the film and television school of PSL Research University. 
FEMIS (pronounced [femis]) is an acronym for Fondation Européenne pour les Métiers de l'Image et du Son. Based in Paris, it offers courses balanced between artistic research, professional development and technical training.
In 2012, The Hollywood Reporter rated La fémis no.6 in its best international film school rankings (it included U.S.-based film schools)  and no.3 in its 2014 best international film school rankings (it excluded U.S.-based film schools). Its alumni have won three of the world's most prestigious film prizes - Cannes Film Festival's Golden Palm, Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion and Berlin International Film Festival's Golden Bear - ten times, making it the most rewarded film school in the world, preceding the Beijing Film Academy and the Tisch School of the Arts of New York City, in winning those three prizes.
