Boris Said (May 5, 1932 in New York City – March 24, 2002 in Seattle), commonly called "Bob", was an American racing driver from the United States.
Said was the first American to win a road race in Europe after World War II – the 1953 Rouen Grand Prix. He participated in the first Formula One United States Grand Prix at Sebring on December 12, 1959.  He spun off on the first lap and scored no World Championship points. He also made one NASCAR start, the 1959 Daytona 500 where he finished 50th after a transmission failure.
Said was also a bobsled racer, competing in the Olympics twice, 1968 in Grenoble and in 1972 at Sapporo, Japan achieving a best result of tenth. The 1968 games were notable as he competed against another racing driver-come-bobsledder, Robin Widdows.
Later he was the executive producer of a documentary entitled Mystery of the Sphynx.
His son, Boris Said III, is a retired NASCAR driver and road course ringer.
