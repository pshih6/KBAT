The Windward Islands, also known as the Islands of Barlovento, are the southern, generally larger islands of the Lesser Antilles, within the West Indies. They lie south of the Leeward Islands, approximately between latitudes 10째 and 16째 N and longitudes 60째 and 62째 W. 
The name was also used to refer to a British colony in these islands, existing between 1833 and 1960 and consisting of the islands of:
Saint Lucia, 
Saint Vincent, 
the Grenadines, 
Grenada.  The island of Dominica was traditionally a part of the Leeward Islands until 1940, when it was transferred from the Leeward Islands colony to the Windward Islands.)
