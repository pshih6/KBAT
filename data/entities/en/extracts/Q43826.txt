Weiß Ferdl (28 June 1883 – 19 June 1949, real name: Ferdinand Weisheitinger) was a German actor, humorous folksinger, and author. He appeared in 19 films between 1928 and 1941 and performed regularly at the Platzl, a well-known Munich theater.
His famous song Ein Wagen von der Linie Acht is still played to this day. It is a mocking song about Munich people and Munich tram. A Munich school, named after Weiß Ferdl, still has a blue streetcar in the yard, to remember this song.
