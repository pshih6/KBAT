Lana Wachowski (born June 21, 1965) and Lilly Wachowski (born December 29, 1967) are American film and television directors, writers and producers. The sisters are both trans women.Collectively known as the Wachowskis (), they have worked as a writing and directing team through most of their professional film careers. They made their directing debut in 1996 with Bound, and achieved fame with their second film The Matrix (1999), a major box office success for which they won the Saturn Award for Best Director. They wrote and directed its two sequels: The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions (both in 2003), and were involved in the writing and production of other works in that franchise.
Following the commercial success of The Matrix series, they wrote and produced the 2005 film V for Vendetta (an adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore & David Lloyd), and in 2008 released the film Speed Racer, a live-action adaptation of the Japanese anime series. Their next film, Cloud Atlas, based on the novel by David Mitchell and co-written and co-directed by Tom Tykwer, was released in 2012. Their film Jupiter Ascending and the Netflix series Sense8, which they co-created with J. Michael Straczynski, both debuted in 2015; the second season of Sense8 ended the series in 2018 and was Lana's first major creative undertaking without Lilly.Since the series finale of Sense8, the Wachowskis have been working separately on different projects: Lilly is writing and executive-producing Showtime's Work in Progress (2019) with creators Abby McEnany and Tim Mason, while Lana is filming a fourth Matrix film planned for 2021, which she wrote with David Mitchell and Aleksander Hemon.
