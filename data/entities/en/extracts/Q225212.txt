Harald III (Harald the Whetstone, Danish: Harald Hen; c. 1040 – April 17, 1080) was King of Denmark from 1076 to 1080. Harald III was an illegitimate son of Danish king Sweyn II Estridsson, and contested the crown with some of his brothers. He was a peaceful ruler who initiated a number of reforms. Harald was married to his cousin Margareta Hasbjörnsdatter, but did not leave any heirs, and was succeeded by his brother Canute IV the Saint. Four of his half-brothers were in turn crowned Danish kings, with his youngest brother becoming the Danish king known as Harald IV (Harald the Young), Danish: Harald Olpe.
