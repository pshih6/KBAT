Pierre Jean Marie Laval (French pronunciation: ​[pjɛʁ laval]; 28 June 1883 – 15 October 1945) was a French politician.  During the time of the Third Republic, he served as Prime Minister of France from 27 January 1931 to 20 February 1932, and a second time from 7 June 1935 to 24 January 1936.
A socialist early in his life, Laval became a lawyer in 1909 and was famous for his defense of strikers, trade unionists and leftists against government prosecution. In 1914, he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a member of the Socialist Party, and remained committed to his pacifist convictions during the First World War. Following his defeat in the 1919 election, Laval left the Socialist Party and became mayor of Aubervilliers. In 1924 he returned to the Chamber as an independent, and was elected to the Senate three years later. He also held a series of governmental positions, including Minister of Public Works, Ministry of Justice and Minister of Labour. In 1931, Laval became Prime Minister of France, but his government fell only a year later. 
Laval joined the right-wing government of Gaston Doumergue in 1934, serving as Minister of the Colonies and then Foreign Minister. In 1935, he again became Prime Minister. Seeking to contain Germany, Laval pursued foreign policies favourable to Italy and the Soviet Union, but his handling of the Abyssinia Crisis—widely denounced as appeasement of Benito Mussolini—prompted his resignation in 1936. Following France's defeat and armistice with Germany in 1940, Laval served in prominent roles in Philippe Pétain's Vichy Regime, first as the vice-president of the Council of Ministers from July 1940 to December 1940, and later as the head of government from April 1942 to August 1944. The collaborationist government provided French labourers for Germany, and organized the deportation of Jews who did not have French citizenship.After the liberation of France in 1944, Laval fled to Spain but was soon deported back to France, where he was arrested by the French government under General Charles de Gaulle. Laval was found guilty of plotting against the security of the State and collaboration with the enemy, and after a thwarted suicide attempt, he was executed by firing squad in October 1945. Laval's manifold political activities left a complicated and controversial legacy, resulting in more than a dozen conflicting biographies of him.
