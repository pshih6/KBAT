Saint-Tropez (US:  SAN-troh-PAY, French: [sɛ̃ tʁɔpe]; Occitan: Sant-Tropetz , pronounced [san(t) tʀuˈpes]) is a town on the French Riviera, 68 kilometres (42 miles) west of Nice and 100 kilometres (62 miles) east of Marseille in the Var department of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region of Occitania, Southern France.
Saint-Tropez was a military stronghold and fishing village until the beginning of the 20th century. It was the first town on this coast to be liberated during World War II as part of Operation Dragoon. After the war, it became an internationally known seaside resort, renowned principally because of the influx of artists of the French New Wave in cinema and the Yé-yé movement in music. It later became a resort for the European and American jet set and tourists.
