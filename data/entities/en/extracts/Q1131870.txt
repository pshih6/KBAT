Coral Records was a subsidiary of Decca Records that was formed in 1949. Coral released music by the McGuire Sisters, Teresa Brewer, and Buddy Holly.Jazz and swing music were issued by Coral in the 1940s. After Bob Thiele became head of the label in 1954, he produced pop and rock musicians such as Buddy Holly, Jackie Wilson, Lawrence Welk, and Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorm√©. He also produced hit songs by his wife, Teresa Brewer.Coral stopped issuing new material in 1971. In 1973, MCA amalgamated Decca, Kapp Records, and Uni Records under the single MCA Records banner, and Coral was repositioned as a mid-line and budget album reissue label in the U.S. and internationally. This version of Coral (MCA Coral) lasted into the 1980s. Some product from MCA's former Vocalion Records budget label was manufactured with MCA Coral labels that bore Vocalion catalog numbers and was shipped in sleeves still bearing the Vocalion trademark, presumably to cut costs.
