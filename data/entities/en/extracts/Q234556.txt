Brooke Ellen Bollea (born May 5, 1988), better known by her stage name Brooke Hogan, is an American reality television star, actress, singer-songwriter, media personality, and former on-screen personality for Impact Wrestling. She is the daughter of professional wrestler Hulk Hogan and television personality Linda Hogan. Brooke took an early interest in music, and began working on her first studio album in 2002. In an attempt to promote her music career, Hogan and her father appeared in a one-hour special on VH1. The special proved to be a ratings success, leading to Hogan and her family starring in the reality television series Hogan Knows Best (2005–07). The show saw a then teenage Brooke struggling with her overprotective father and recording her debut album. Her first studio album, Undiscovered, was released in 2006. It was preceded by the single "About Us", which entered the top-forty of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
While Hogan began working on her second album, personal struggles among her family led to the cancellation of Hogan Knows Best. This led to Hogan starring in her own television series, Brooke Knows Best (2008–09). Though her parents and brother made numerous appearances throughout the series, it mainly focused on Brooke and the recording of her new music. Hogan's second studio album, The Redemption (2009), failed to match the success of its predecessor. The album spawned two singles, neither of which had much success. Following the conclusion of Brooke Knows Best, Hogan pursued a career in acting, making numerous appearances in low budget films and television shows. In 2012, Hogan signed on to appear on Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), alongside her father. She was released from the series after a year on the program. Hogan starred in the satire film L.A. Slasher (2015), and is working on a new extended play consisting of country music.
