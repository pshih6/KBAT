Johann Michael Moscherosch (March 7, 1601 – April 4, 1669), German statesman,  satirist, and educator, was born at Willstätt, on the Upper Rhine near Strassburg.
His bitterly brilliant but partisan writings graphically describe life in a Germany ravaged by the Thirty Years' War (1618–48). His satires, which at times are tedious, also show an overwhelming moral zeal added to a sense of mission.
