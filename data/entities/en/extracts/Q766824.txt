Crystal Castles is a Canadian electronic music group formed in 2006 in Toronto, Ontario, by songwriter-producer Ethan Kath and singer-songwriter Alice Glass. The current band members are Ethan Kath and Edith Frances. Crystal Castles are known for their chaotic live shows and lo-fi melancholic homemade productions. They released many limited vinyl singles between 2006 and 2007 before releasing a trilogy of critically acclaimed albums between 2008 and 2012.
Producer Kath and vocalist Glass first collaborated in 2006 on the track "Alice Practice", a proof-of-concept which was initially shelved for six months. After being posted online, this track garnered attention and the duo decided to re-form for a formal release. In 2006 the group released their first physical four-track EP Alice Practice on vinyl. Their debut album, Crystal Castles, was released in 2008. In 2009, it was listed on NME's "Top 100 Greatest Albums of the Decade" list at No. 39.In 2010, their second album, titled (II), charted on the Billboard 200, and includes their first worldwide charting single, "Not In Love", featuring vocalist Robert Smith of The Cure. Their third album, (III), was released on November 12, 2012, and was the number one album of 2012 on Tumblr and Hype Machine. The album included four singles: "Plague", "Wrath of God", "Sad Eyes" and "Affection".
Glass announced her departure from the band in October 2014, citing personal and professional reasons. In April 2015, a new Crystal Castles track, "Frail", was released featuring new vocalist Edith Frances. August 19, 2016, marked the release of their fourth and most-recent album, Amnesty (I).
