Nob. Carlo Maria Buonaparte or Carlo Maria di Buonaparte (27 March 1746 â€“ 24 February 1785) was an Italian lawyer and diplomat who is best known as the father of Napoleon Bonaparte.
He served briefly as a personal assistant of the revolutionary leader Pasquale Paoli, and fought with the Corsican resistance against the French during the occupation of Corsica. With the island conquered and the resistance defeated, he eventually rose to become Corsica's representative to the court of Louis XVI. It was well after his death that his second surviving son, Napoleon, became Emperor of the French; subsequently, several of Buonaparte's other children received royal titles from their brother, and married into royalty.
