Chanda Kochhar (n√©e Advani, born 17 November 1961) is the former managing director and chief executive officer of ICICI Bank. However, on 4 October 2018 she stepped down from her position following allegations of corruption.  Amidst investigations related to Videocon bad loans, she was forced by the board of ICICI Bank to take indefinite leave. The Central Bureau of Investigation named Chanda Kochhar and her husband as beneficiaries in the financial fraud. The Justice B N Shrikrishna probe panel reported that Kochhar had violated ICICI Bank's Code of Conduct, following which her service was terminated with all her entitlements and benefits revoked. After her exit, Sandeep Bakhshi, who was the interim Managing Director and CEO became the full-time MD and CEO.
