Charles, Prince Napoléon (Charles Marie Jérôme Victor Napoléon; born 19 October 1950 in Boulogne-Billancourt) is a French politician, and is recognised by some Bonapartists as the head of the Imperial House of France and as heir to the rights and legacy established by his great-great-grand-uncle, Emperor Napoléon I. Other Bonapartists consider his son, Jean-Christophe, to be the current head of the house and heir.
