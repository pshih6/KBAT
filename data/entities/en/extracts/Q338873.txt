Arkady Dmitrievich Shvetsov (Russian: Аркадий Дмитриевич Швецов) (January 1892, Nizhniye Sergi, today's Sverdlovsk Oblast - 19 March 1953, Moscow) was a Soviet aircraft engine designer whose OKB was founded in Perm, USSR, in 1934, to produce the Wright Cyclone-derived Shvetsov M-25 engine. Under Shvetsov, his OKB became the primary provider of radial piston engines for Soviet aircraft industry (Mikulin's and Klimov's OKB were assigned to creation of in-line engines). After his death in 1953, the OKB was taken over by Pavel Soloviev.
