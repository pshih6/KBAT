Edge and Christian (E&C) was a tag team made of real life best friends Edge (Adam Copeland) and Christian (Jason Reso). They are best known for their time in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), later renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) where they won the WWF Tag Team Championship on seven occasions. Initially, the two were portrayed as on-screen brothers, but the aspect was de-emphasized in the mid-2000s, and in 2010, the team was officially retconned as childhood friends. The team split up in 2001 but reunited briefly on the SmackDown brand in 2011. Edge, however, announced his retirement from professional wrestling due to neck injury on the April 11 episode of Monday Night Raw, which would ultimately end their final run together.
In addition to their seven reigns as WWF Tag Team Champions, they each won singles titles during their run as a tag team. Edge and Christian are also noteworthy for their participation in the first three Tables, Ladders, and Chairs matches (TLC matches). In 2012, WWE named them the greatest tag team in WWE history. The team's popularity propelled Edge and Christian to main event success, with both men becoming multiple-time world champions in their own right.
