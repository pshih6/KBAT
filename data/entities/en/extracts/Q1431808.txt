Loop (ループ, Rūpu) is a horror novel by Japanese writer Koji Suzuki, and the third in his series of Ring.
The story revolves around a simulated reality, exactly the same as our own, known as the Loop: created to simulate the emergence and evolution of life. It is in this alternate universe that the events of the previous novels, Ring and Spiral took place.
