Masaru Emoto (江本 勝, Emoto Masaru, July 22, 1943 – October 17, 2014) was a Japanese author and pseudo-scientist who said that human consciousness has an effect on the molecular structure of water. Emoto's book The Hidden Messages in Water published in 2004 was a New York Times best seller. Emoto's conjecture evolved over the years, and his early work revolved around pseudo-scientific hypotheses that water could react to positive thoughts and words and that polluted water could be cleaned through prayer and positive visualization.From 1999, Emoto published several volumes of a work entitled Messages from Water, which contain photographs of ice crystals and accompanying experiments.
