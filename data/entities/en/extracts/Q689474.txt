Jean-Guihen Queyras is a French cellist. He was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on 11 March 1967, and moved with his parents to Algeria when he was 5 years old; the family moved to France 3 years later. He is a professor at the Musikhochschule Freiburg and artistic co-director of the Rencontres Musicales de Haute-Provence. He won the Glenn Gould Protégé Prize in Toronto in 2002.

He is noted for his exceptionally wide range of repertoire: he has recorded cello concertos by Haydn, Monn, and Vivaldi on a period instrument with the Freiburger Barockorchester and the Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin, but also champions the music of Dallapiccola, Kurtag, Ligeti, Webern, and others.
