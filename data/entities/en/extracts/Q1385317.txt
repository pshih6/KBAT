Warren Kendall Lewis (21 August 1882 â€“ 9 March 1975) was an MIT professor who has been called the father of modern chemical engineering.  He co-authored an early major textbook on the subject which essentially introduced the concept of unit operations.  He also co-developed the Houdry process under contract to The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (now ExxonMobil) into modern fluid catalytic cracking with Edwin R. Gilliland, another MIT professor.
