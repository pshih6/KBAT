John Amery (14 March 1912 â€“ 19 December 1945) was a pro-Nazi British fascist. In 1942, while in Germany during the Second World War, he proposed the  formation of a British volunteer force (made up from former prisoners of war) as part of the German military. This idea became the British Free Corps, a small unit of the Waffen-SS. Amery also conducted recruitment efforts, and made propaganda broadcasts for Germany. He later gave direct support to Benito Mussolini. He was prosecuted by the British and pleaded guilty to eight counts of high treason, for which he was sentenced to execution, seven months after the war in Europe ended.
