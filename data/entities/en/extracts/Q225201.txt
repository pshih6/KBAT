Alcimus Ecdicius Avitus (c. 450 â€“ February 5, 517/518 or 519) was a Latin poet and bishop of Vienne in Gaul. His fame rests in part on his poetry, but also on the role he played as secretary for the Burgundian kings.
Avitus was born of a prominent Gallo-Roman senatorial family related to Emperor Avitus.
