The South Schleswig Voters' Association (Danish: Sydslesvigsk Vælgerforening, German: Südschleswigscher Wählerverband, North Frisian: Söödschlaswiksche Wäälerferbånd) is a regionalist political party in Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany. The party represents the Danish and Frisian minorities of the state.As a party representing a national minority, the SSW declines to identify itself with a left-right political scale, but it models its policies on those of the Nordic countries, which often means favouring a strong welfare state, but, on the other hand, a more free market labour policy than the German social market economy model. The SSW is represented in the Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein and several regional and municipal councils. The party has not contested any federal elections in Germany since 1965.
As a party for the national Danish minority in Southern Schleswig, the SSW is not subject to the general requirement of passing a 5% vote threshold to gain proportional seats in either the state parliament (Landtag) or the federal German parliament (Bundestag). In the most recent 2017 state election, the SSW received 3.3% of the votes and three seats.
