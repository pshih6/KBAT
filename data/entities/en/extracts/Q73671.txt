Maximilian Karl Otto von Herff (17 April 1893 – 6 September 1945) was a high-ranking commander in the SS of Nazi Germany during World War II. The protestant von Herff family originated from Liège in Belgium and moved to the Palatinate in 1577 to escape religious persecution. His ancestor Christian Herff had been inducted into the noble class in 1814.
