Blind Pig Records is an American blues independent record label.
Blind Pig was formed in 1977 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, by Jerry Del Giudice, owner of the Blind Pig Cafe, and his friend Edward Chmelewski. The label is now based in San Francisco. In the late 2000s the label started a reissue vinyl series, featuring reissues from its back catalog on 180-gram high quality vinyl.
As of 2015, Blind Pig's catalogue is owned by The Orchard, a division of Sony Music.
