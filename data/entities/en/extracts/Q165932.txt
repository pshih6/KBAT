Wolf Blood, also known as Wolfblood: A Tale of the Forest, is a silent 1925 werewolf film starring George Chesebro, who also co-directed it with B-serial veteran Bruce M. Mitchell. The film has been referenced in a number of books as being the first werewolf movie ever made. This however is erroneous; the first werewolf movie is The Werewolf, a film made in 1913. However that film is considered to be lost. Therefore, Wolf Blood could be called the earliest surviving werewolf film. Wolf Blood is available commercially as an extra on a DVD together with F.W. Murnau's The Haunted Castle.
