Saint Clement of Ohrid (Bulgarian and Macedonian: Свети Климент Охридски, lit. 'Sveti Kliment Okridski'; Greek: Άγιος Κλήμης της Αχρίδας; Slovak: svätý Kliment Ochridský; c. 840 – 916) was one of the first Medieval Bulgarian saints, scholar, writer and enlightener of the Slavs. He is the most prominent disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius and is often associated with the creation of the Glagolitic and Cyrillic scripts, especially their popularisation among Christianised Slavs. He was the founder of the Ohrid Literary School and is regarded as a patron of education and language by some Slavic people. He is considered to be the first bishop of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, one of the seven Apostles of the First Bulgarian Empire and one of the premier saints of modern Bulgaria. Saint Clement is also the patron saint of North Macedonia, the city of Ohrid and the Macedonian Orthodox Church.
