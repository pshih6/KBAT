Thihathu of Ava (Burmese: သီဟသူ, pronounced [θìha̰ðù]; also known as Aung Pinle Hsinbyushin Thihathu; 1394–1425) was king of Ava from 1421 to 1425. Though he opportunistically renewed the Forty Years' War with Hanthawaddy Pegu in 1422, Thihathu agreed to a peace treaty with Prince Binnya Ran in 1423. His subsequent marriage to Ran's sister Princess Shin Saw Pu helped keep the peace between the two kingdoms when Ran became king of Pegu in 1424.
Thihathu was assassinated in 1425 in a coup engineered by Queen Shin Bo-Me. He is remembered as the Aung Pinle Hsinbyushin (Burmese: အောင်ပင်လယ် ဆင်ဖြူရှင် [ʔàʊɴ bɪ̀ɴlɛ̀ sʰɪ̀ɴbjùʃɪ̀ɴ]; lit. Lord of the White Elephant of Aung Pinle) nat in the pantheon of Burmese nat spirits.
