Baháʼu'lláh (; Persian : بهاءالله    ; 12 November 1817 – 29 May 1892), born Mírzá Ḥusayn-ʻAlí Núrí (Persian: میرزا حسین‌علی نوری‎), was a Persian religious leader, and the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, which advocates universal peace and unity among all races, nations, and religions.
At the age of 27, Baháʼu'lláh became a follower of the Báb, a Persian merchant who began preaching that God would soon send a new prophet similar to Jesus or Muhammad. The Báb and thousands of followers were executed by the Iranian authorities for their beliefs. Baháʼu'lláh faced exile from his native Iran, and in Baghdad in 1863 claimed to be the expected prophet of whom the Báb foretold. Thus, Baháʼís regard Baháʼu'lláh to be a Manifestation of God, fulfilling the eschatological expectations of Islam, Christianity, and other major religions.Baháʼu'lláh faced further imprisonment under Ottoman authorities, initially in Edirne, and ultimately to the prison city of Acre (present-day Israel), where he spent his final 24 years of life. His burial place is a destination of pilgrimage for his followers, and the Baháʼí World Centre sits in nearby Haifa.
