Deutschlandradio (DLR) is a national German  public radio broadcaster. It operates four national networks:

Deutschlandfunk: mainly news and information
Deutschlandfunk Kultur: culture in a broader sense
Deutschlandfunk Nova: aimed at young adults, mainly spoken-word
Dokumente und Debatten: opt-out channel, often for special eventsDeutschlandfunk was originally a West German news radio targeting listeners within West Germany as well as in neighbouring countries, Deutschlandfunk Kultur is the result of a merger of West Berlin's RIAS station and East Berlin's DS Kultur after German reunification. Both networks that used to broadcast mainly on the AM bands have since spread throughout Germany, having been allocated many additional FM transmitters. However, because of lack of analogue frequencies, Deutschlandradio changed his distribution strategy already in 2003 to digital terrestrial transmission. 
Dokumente und Debatten is a digital-only special-event channel. It broadcasts coverage of the federal parliament, sports events, talk shows and shipping forecasts.  Many of the talk shows are rebroadcasts of the audio portions of TV shows made by ARD, ZDF or Phoenix.   It uses digital frequencies of both Deutschlandfunk and Deutschlandfunk Kultur.
Deutschlandfunk Nova is knowledge orientated station, started in 2010, targeting a younger audience, and broadcast only digitally - via satellite, cable, DAB, and online.
Deutschlandradio is based in Cologne, with some departments—including Deutschlandfunk Kultur—based in Berlin.
