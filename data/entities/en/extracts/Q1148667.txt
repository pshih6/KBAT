Miyuki-chan in Wonderland (Japanese: 不思議の国の美幸ちゃん, Hepburn: Fushigi no Kuni no Miyuki-chan) is a comedy, yuri (love between women) manga written and illustrated by Clamp, an all-female manga artist team consisting of Satsuki Igarashi, Mokona, Tsubaki Nekoi, and Nanase Ohkawa. The story focuses on the eponymous protagonist, a Japanese high-school girl who finds herself pulled into various worlds populated by women who consider her appealing.
Miyuki-chan in Wonderland appeared as a serial in the manga magazine Newtype from 1993 to 1995, based on the children's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. Kadokawa Shoten collected the seven chapters into one bound volume and published it in September 1995. While the concept of Miyuki-chan in Wonderland was initially imagined as the first chapter by writer Ohkawa, the team continued with it for the enjoyment it provided. An image album and an original video animation adaptation of the first two chapters were published in 1995.
In 2002, Tokyopop announced that it had licensed Miyuki-chan in Wonderland for an English-language translation, and published it in October 2003. It is now out of print. It received a range of critical reaction from reviewers, from praise as cute entertainment to criticism as the worst of Clamp's works. The eponymous protagonist has made cameo appearances in other works by Clamp: the music video Clamp in Wonderland (1994) and the fantasy manga series Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle (2003–2009). Viz Media acquired the rights to the manga and digitally published it on September 24, 2014.
