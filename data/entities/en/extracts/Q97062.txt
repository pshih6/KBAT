Hermann Axen (6 March 1916 â€“ 15 February 1992) was a German political activist who became involved in political resistance during the twelve Nazi years, most of which he spent in state detention.   After the war he became a national politician in the Soviet occupation zone, relaunched in 1949 as the German Democratic Republic / East Germany.   He served as a relatively high-profile member of the powerful Politburo of the Central Committee between 1970 and 1989.In November 1989 he visited Moscow for eye surgery.   While he was away the entire Politburo of which he was a member, resigned in 8 November 1989, and he too was excluded from it.  On his return in January 1990 he was arrested, suspected of corruption and abuse of public office.   This dramatic reversal of fortune came during a period of rapid political change.   At the time of his death the arrest warrant had been rescinded and the case against him remained unproven, the necessary investigations having been delayed or suspended in response to his declining health.
