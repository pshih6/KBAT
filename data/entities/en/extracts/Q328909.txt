Louis Edmond Duranty (6 June 1833 – 9 April 1880) was a prolific French novelist and art critic.Duranty supported the realist cause and later the Impressionists.  He was challenged to a duel in 1870 by Édouard Manet over an affront.  He was a friend of Edgar Degas, who painted a celebrated portrait of him in 1879 (Burrell Collection, Glasgow). He was a frequent visitor to the Café Guerbois. Also the author of The New Painting.
Duranty adopted 'truth' as the slogan of his short-lived journal Réalisme (1856–57), and in the second volume he composed principles of realism.
