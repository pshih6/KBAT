How the Grinch Stole Christmas (also known as Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas and simply The Grinch in the UK) is a 2000 American Christmas fantasy comedy film directed by Ron Howard and written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman. Based on Dr. Seuss's 1957 book of the same name, it was the first Dr. Seuss book to be adapted into a full-length feature film. The film is narrated by Anthony Hopkins and stars Jim Carrey in the title role along with Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin and Molly Shannon in supporting roles, as well as introducing Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who.
Because the film is based on a children's picture book, many additions were made to the storyline in order to bring it up to feature-length, including some information about the backstory of the title character and reworking the story's minor character Cindy Lou Who as a main character. Most of the rhymes that were used in the book were also used in the film, though some of the lines were to some degree changed and several new rhymes were put in. The film also borrowed some music and character elements that originated in the 1966 animated television special, such as the song "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch" and the Grinch's green skin tone.
Produced by Howard and Brian Grazer's Imagine Entertainment, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was released by Universal Pictures in the United States on November 17 and received mixed reviews from critics who criticized the screenplay, characters and innuendos but praised the musical score, Carreyâ€™s performance and production values. The film grossed over $345 million worldwide, becoming the sixth-highest grossing film of 2000 and was originally the second highest-grossing holiday film of all-time behind Home Alone (1990), until both films were surpassed in 2018 by the third film adaptation of the story. It won the Academy Award for Best Makeup as well as getting nominations for Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.
