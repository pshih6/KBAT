William Wilson (13 November 1844 in London, England â€“ 1 June 1912 in Glasgow, Scotland) was a late 19th-century British journalist, swimming instructor and coach, and contributor to the scientific techniques behind competitive swimming. In 1883, Wilson published "The Swimming Instructor," one of the first books on swimming to define modern concepts of stroke efficiency, training, racing turns and water safety.
