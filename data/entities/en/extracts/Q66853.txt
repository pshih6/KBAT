Manegold of Lautenbach (c. 1030 â€“ c. 1103) was a religious and polemical writer and Augustinian canon from Alsace, active mostly as a teacher in south-west Germany. William of Champeaux may have been one of his pupils, but this is disputed. He was one of the first magisters, recognised masters of theology.
