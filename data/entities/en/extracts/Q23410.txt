Orli Shoshan (Hebrew: אורלי שושן‎; born July 23, 1974) is an Israeli film actress best known for her performance as the Togruta Jedi Master Shaak Ti in the 1999–2005 Star Wars prequel trilogy. It is believed that Shaak Ti's expertise in melee combat is in homage to Orli Shoshan, a former member of the Israeli Defense Forces and a skilled hand-to-hand combat and melee weapons artist.
