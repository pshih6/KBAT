Paul Henckels (9 September 1885 – 27 May 1967) was a German film and stage actor. He appeared in more than 230 films between 1921 and 1965. Paul Henckels had started his acting career on the stage in the 1900s.
Although his father was Jewish and he was considered a "Half-Jew" by the rules of the Nazis, Henckels was still allowed to work during the Third Reich, mainly because of the help of his friend Gustaf Gründgens and his popularity as a character actor. He was well known for his eccentric, colourful roles and his trademark Rhineland accent. Among his most popular roles were the school teacher Professor Bömmel in Die Feuerzangenbowle (1944) and the veterinarian Dr. Pudlich in the "Immenhof film series" during the 1950s. He was also notable as a stage actor and appeared at the Schauspielhaus Berlin for many years. His most popular stage role was Wibbel the Tailor which he played more than 1000 times.
