Sir Frederick Charles Frank, OBE, FRS (6 March 1911 – 5 April 1998), known as Sir Charles Frank, was a British theoretical physicist. He is best known for his work on crystal dislocations, including (with Thornton Read) the idea of the Frank–Read source of dislocations. He also proposed the cyclol reaction in the mid-1930s, and made many other contributions to solid-state physics, geophysics, and the theory of liquid crystals.
