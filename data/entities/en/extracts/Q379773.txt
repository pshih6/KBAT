Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin (December 7, 1805 – June 13, 1871) was a French watchmaker, magician and illusionist, widely recognized as the father of the modern style of conjuring.  He transformed magic from a pastime for the lower classes, seen at fairs, to an entertainment for the wealthy, which he offered in a theatre opened in Paris, a legacy preserved by the tradition of modern magicians to perform in tails.
