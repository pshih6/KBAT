Avi Mograbi (Hebrew: אבי מוגרבי‎; born 1956) is an Israeli documentary filmmaker.
Mograbi’s distant relative founded The Mograbi Cinema (Kolnoa Mograbi), an Art Deco movie theatre in downtown Tel Aviv. It was probably Israel’s most famous movie palace, having opened in 1930. It was the site of one of the largest celebrations following the 1948 partition, and remained a vital national landmark until its demolition in the 1990s.
