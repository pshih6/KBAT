Wasei Kingu Kongu (和製キング・コング, lit. Japanese King Kong) was a 1933 Japanese black-and-white silent film directed by Torajiro Saito. It was a silent 3-reel comedy short that uses the  1933 film King Kong as a backdrop to the story and was produced by Shochiku Studios (which released the original 1933 film in Japan on behalf of RKO). It is now considered to be a lost film.
