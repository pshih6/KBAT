Lobsang Trinley Lhündrub Chökyi Gyaltsen, born Gönbo Cêdän (19 February 1938 – 28 January 1989), was the tenth Panchen Lama, officially the 10th Panchen Erdeni (Chinese: 第十世班禅额尔德尼; literally: 'Number-10-lifetime Great Scholar the Treasure'), of the Gelug School of Tibetan Buddhism. He was often referred to simply as Choekyi Gyaltsen (which can be Choekyi Gyaltse, Choskyi Gyantsen, etc.), although this is also the name of several other notable figures in Tibetan history.
