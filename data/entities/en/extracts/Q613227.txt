Toyota Stadium (豊田スタジアム, Toyota Sutajiamu) is a 45,000 seat retractable roof stadium in Toyota, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. It was built in 2001 and is often used as home to the J1 League club Nagoya Grampus. The stadium is football-specific, which gives matches an authentic football aura; however, its location outside Nagoya city makes it impractical for consolidating the club's fan base in its billed hometown.
It is also used by Toyota Verblitz, a rugby union team in the Top League.
Its roof is unique in that it folds much like an accordion; however, the roof has never been closed since 2015 due to extra costs for maintenance. 
Toyota Stadium is one of the venues of the FIFA Club World Cup (formerly the Toyota Cup). The stadium was also used as one of the venues for 2019 Rugby World Cup, the first Rugby World Cup to be held in Asia.
