Alexander Robey Shepherd (January 30, 1835 â€“ September 12, 1902), better known as Boss Shepherd, was one of the most controversial and influential civic leaders in the history of Washington, D.C., and one of the most powerful big-city political bosses of the Gilded Age.  He was head of the DC Board of Public Works from 1871 to 1873 and Governor of the District of Columbia from 1873 to 1874.  He is known, particularly in Washington, as "The Father of Modern Washington."
