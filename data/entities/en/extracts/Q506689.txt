Carlos António Castro (5 October 1945 – 7 January 2011) was a Portuguese television personality and journalist who, for over 35 years, covered mainly gossip items about musicians, actors, and celebrities. He became well known after he came out on television and participated in Big Show SIC, presented by João Baião, in the 1990s. 
On 7 January 2011 he was found castrated and bludgeoned to death in a New York City hotel. The main suspect in his death was his boyfriend, 21-year-old male model Renato Seabra, who had been a contestant on the Portuguese television modeling-themed reality show À Procura do Sonho (PT) (SIC). On 10 January 2011 Renato Seabra was charged with second-degree murder by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) after confessing to the killing of Castro. He was sentenced to 25 years to life on 21 December 2012.
