Woluwe-Saint-Lambert (French pronunciation: ​[wolywe sɛ̃ lɑ̃bɛːʁ]) or Sint-Lambrechts-Woluwe (Dutch, pronounced [sɪnt ˈlɑmbrɛxts ˈwoːlywə] (listen)) is one of the nineteen municipalities in the Brussels-Capital Region of Belgium. It is a prosperous residential area, with a mixture of flats and detached, semi-detached and terraced houses, often compared with Uccle (Ukkel in Dutch), another affluent Brussels municipality, and the 14th or 17th arrondissement in Paris.
In common with all the Brussels municipalities, it is legally bilingual (French–Dutch). In French it is often spelt Woluwé-Saint-Lambert with an acute accent on the first 'e' to reflect the Frenchified pronunciation of what was originally a Dutch place name, but the official spelling is without an accent.
The neighbouring municipality of Woluwe-Saint-Pierre also lies within the Brussels-Capital Region, while the former municipality of Sint-Stevens-Woluwe (Woluwe-Saint-Etienne in French) has been merged with three other municipalities (Zaventem, Nossegem and Sterrebeek) to form the municipality of Zaventem, which is in the province of Flemish Brabant in Flanders.
