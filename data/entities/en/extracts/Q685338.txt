The Armenian Cemetery of Moscow (Armenian: Մոսկվայի Հայկական Գերեզմանատուն, Russian: Армя́нское Вага́ньковское кла́дбище, Armyanskoe Vagan'kovskoe Kladbishche) is an Armenian historical cemetery in the city of Moscow, Russia, located in the Krasnaya Presnya (Красная Пресня) district, not far from Vagankovo Cemetery. It is established in 1804, by the initiative of Minas Lazarev, the leader of Moscow Armenian community, who also initiated the construction of Surb Harutyun Armenian church (1808–1815). The Lazarev Family crypt is located under the church. The cemetery and the church are under the state protection. Among the state-protected monuments are the obelisk on A.A. Loris-Melikov's tomb (1844), tombs of Ananov's, constructed by medieval Armenian canons, khachkar on D.S. Melik-Beglyarov's tomb (1913), Nikolai Tarasov's tomb, a modernist style work by sculptor Nikolai Andreev. There are also a large number of graves of well-known personalities who are not of Armenian origin in the Armenian cemetery.
