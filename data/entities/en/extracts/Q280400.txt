Matilda is a 1996 American family comedy fantasy film co-produced and directed by Danny DeVito from a screenplay written by Nicholas Kazan and Robin Swicord. Based on Roald Dahl's novel of the same name, the film stars Mara Wilson as the title character with DeVito, Rhea Perlman, Embeth Davidtz, and Pam Ferris in supporting roles. The film centers on a young genius girl named Matilda Wormwood, who develops psychokinetic abilities and uses them to deal with her disreputable family and Agatha Trunchbull, the ruthless, oppressive and tyrannical principal of Crunchem Hall Elementary School.
Produced by DeVito's Jersey Films and released theatrically in the United States on August 2, 1996 by TriStar Pictures, the film received predominantly positive reviews from critics but was a box office bomb, grossing only $33 million in the United States on a $36 million budget.
