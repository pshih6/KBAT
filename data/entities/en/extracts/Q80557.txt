Illustrious Corpses (Italian: Cadaveri eccellenti) is a 1976 Italian thriller film directed by Francesco Rosi and starring Lino Ventura, based on the novel Equal Danger by Leonardo Sciascia (1971). The film was screened at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition.Its title refers to the surrealist game, Cadavre Exquis, invented by Andr√© Breton, in which the participants draw consecutive sections of a figure without seeing what the previous person has drawn, leading to unpredictable results, and is meant to describe the meandering nature of the film with its unpredictable foray into the world of political manipulations, as well as the ("illustrous") corpses of the murdered judges.
In 2008, the film was selected to enter the list of the 100 Italian films to be saved.
