Helge Marcus Ingstad (30 December 1899 â€“ 29 March 2001) was a Norwegian explorer. After mapping some Norse settlements, Ingstad and archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad (his wife) in 1960 found remnants of a Viking settlement in L'Anse aux Meadows in the province of Newfoundland in Canada. They were thus the first to prove conclusively that the Icelandic/ Greenlandic Norsemen such as Leif Erickson had found a way across the Atlantic Ocean to North America, roughly 500 years before Christopher Columbus and John Cabot. He also thought that the mysterious disappearance of the Greenland Norse Settlements in the 14th and 15th centuries could be explained by their emigration to North America.Helge Ingstad died at Diakonhjemmet Hospital in Oslo at the age of 101.
