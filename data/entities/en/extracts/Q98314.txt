John Frederik Jungclaussen (born 4 June 1970) is a German journalist and historian working in the UK.
Jungclaussen writes and speaks about European history since the Enlightenment, Anglo-German relations, and European current affairs. While he remains unconvinced about the benefits of Brexit to the UK economy he is equally sceptical about the long-term future of the post-war European project. "As long as the fundamental structural asymmetry of a monetary union without a fiscal union is ignored, the Europe of Robert Schumann and Jean Monnet is doomed."
