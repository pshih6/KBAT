Kurt Großmann (21 May 1897 – 2 March 1972) began his career as a German journalist.   For reasons of race and politics, he was obliged to emigrate during the Hitler years, living his final decades in Queens, New York.  Although sources sometimes describe him as an American journalist, his preferred working language remained German.   West German newspapers for which he reported from New York during the 1950s and the 1960s included the Rheinischer Merkur and Vorwärts.His experiences as a soldier during the First World War turned Großmann into a powerfully committed pacifist.   He served as General Secretary of the German League for Human Rights between 1926 and 1933.
