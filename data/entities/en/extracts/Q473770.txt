Isaac Leopold Rice (February 22, 1850 â€“ November 2, 1915) was a German-born Jewish American businessman, investor, musicologist, author, and noted chess patron. As part of a successful career in the manufacturing industry, in 1899 he acquired the Holland Torpedo Boat Company, which was renamed the Electric Boat Company and produced submarines for the U.S. and British navies.  It continues today as General Dynamics Electric Boat.
