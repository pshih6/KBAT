Tiggy (born 1970 as Charlotte Vigel) is a Romanian-Danish bubblegum/Eurodance artist.
Tiggy's style is similar to fellow Danish bubblegum artists Aqua and Toy-Box who are famous for their childlike lyrics and catchy rhythms, although several of her songs have a more Medieval fantasy focus than other bubblegum artists.
