Else Ackermann (6 November 1933 â€“ 14 September 2019) was a German physician and pharmacologist who became an East German politician (Christian Democratic Union of Germany).  The report on the power relationships between the citizen and the state which she drafted, and in 1988 presented, known as the "Neuenhagen Letter", was a significant precursor to the changes of 1989 which led to the ending, in the early summer of 1990, of the one-party dictatorship, followed by German reunification later that same year.
