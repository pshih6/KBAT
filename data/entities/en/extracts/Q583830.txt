Saban's Around the World in Eighty Dreams (French: Les Aventures de Carlos) is a French animated series with 26 episodes produced in 1992, animated by Saban Entertainment subsidiary Saban International Paris. The cartoon was adapted to English by Saban Entertainment and broadcast in the United States in first-run syndication in the early 1990s as part of Bohbot Entertainment's "Amazin' Adventures" package.
The show focuses on Carlos (based on the French singer Carlos), his parrot Oscar and three kids whom he adopted who live, together with him, on his own tropical Island. Carlos loves to tell the children stories about how he met world famous important figures in history in spite of the children's disbelief.
With the help of Grandma Tadpole, who lives on one of the beaches of the island, he travels back in time together with the children in order to prove to them that he is right.
Carlos has the ability to transform into an ox when the group is in trouble.
