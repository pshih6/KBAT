The Optimates (; Latin: optimates, "best ones", singular optimas), also known as boni ("good men"), were a conservative political faction in the late Roman Republic.
They formed in reaction against the reforms of the Gracchi brothers—two tribunes of the plebs between 133 and 121 BC who tried to pass an agrarian law to help the urban poor, and a political reform that would have diminished the influence of the senatorial class.  As the Optimates were senators and large landowners, they violently opposed the Gracchi, and finally murdered them, but their program was upheld by several politicians, called the Populares ("favouring the people").  For about 80 years, Roman politics was marked by the confrontation of these two factions.  The Optimates favoured the ancestral Roman laws and customs, as well as the supremacy of the Senate over the popular assemblies and the tribunes of the plebs.  They also rejected the massive extension of Roman citizenship to Rome's Italian allies advocated by the Populares.  Although suspicious of powerful generals, they sided with Pompey when they came to believe that Julius Caesar—himself a Popularis—planned a coup against the Republic.  They disappeared with their defeat in the subsequent Civil War.
While several leaders of the Optimates were patricians—belonging to the oldest noble families—such as Sulla or Scipio Nasica Serapio, many were plebeians: the Caecilii Metelli, Pompey, Cato the Younger, Titus Annius Milo, etc.  Cicero—the most famous Optimas—was even a novus homo (the first of his gens to be senator).
