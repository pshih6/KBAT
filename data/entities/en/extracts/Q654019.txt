Příbor (Czech pronunciation: [ˈpr̝̊iːbor]; German: Freiberg in Mähren [ˌfʁaɪbɛɐ̯k ʔɪn ˈmɛːʁən]) is a town in the Moravian-Silesian Region of the Czech Republic. It has approximately 8,500 inhabitants.
Příbor is located in northeastern Moravia, and is surrounded by the foothills of the Moravian-Silesian Beskids.
Vriburch in the Margraviate of Moravia was first mentioned in a 1251 deed, issued by the Přemyslid margrave Ottokar II. The estates passed to the Bishops of Olomouc in the 14th century. Saint John Sarkander attended the local parish school from 1589; in 1694 a Piarist gymnasium was established, whereafter Příbor developed to a centre of education.

The town is notable as the birthplace, on 6 May 1856, of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. Today, there is a museum at his family home.
