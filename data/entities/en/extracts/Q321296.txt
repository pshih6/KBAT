Starachowice forced labor camp, where he witnessed his father die of typhoid fever;
Mauthausen;
Auschwitz;
a death march to Mauthausen again, after which he was released.The Cap provides a frank account of his survival and includes much of his post-war life covering aspects of his career as an award-winning Israeli journalist after his emigration in 1957.
