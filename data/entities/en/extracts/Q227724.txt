Pope Victor III (c. 1026 â€“ 16 September 1087), born Dauferio, was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from 24 May 1086 to his death. He was the successor of Pope Gregory VII, yet his pontificate is far less impressive in history than his time as Desiderius, the great abbot of Montecassino.
His failing health was the factor that made him so reluctant to accept his pontifical election and his health was so poor that he fell to illness during his coronation. The only literary work of his that remains is his "Dialogues" on the miracles performed by Saint Benedict of Nursia and other saints at Montecassino.Pope Leo XIII beatified him on 23 July 1887.
