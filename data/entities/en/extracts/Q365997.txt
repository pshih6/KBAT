George Alexander Parks (May 29, 1883 â€“ May 11, 1984) was an American engineer who worked in Alaska Territory for most of his career.  Following an unexpected nomination from President Calvin Coolidge, he became the territory's first resident governor.  As governor, he was the first person to serve two complete four-year terms and the first chief executive to travel extensively by air.
