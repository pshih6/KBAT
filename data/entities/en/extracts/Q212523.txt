Jan Karski (24 June 1914 – 13 July 2000) was a Polish resistance-fighter soldier, and later a professor at Georgetown University.
In 1940–43 Karski reported to the Polish Government-in-Exile and to Poland's Western Allies about the situation in German-occupied Poland, especially about Germany's destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto and about Germany's extermination camps on Polish soil that were murdering Jews, Poles, and other nationalities.
