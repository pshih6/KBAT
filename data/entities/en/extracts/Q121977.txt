Martin Karl Hellinger (born 17 July 1904, date of death unknown) was a German Nazi dentist who in 1943 was assigned to work at the concentration camp for women at Ravensbrück, with the duty of removing dental gold from those killed at the camp.
At the first Ravensbrück trial, beginning in 1946, he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. He was released in 1955 with funds to re-establish a dental practice. Details of his later life are unknown.
