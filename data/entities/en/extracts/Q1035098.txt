Buzz Lightyear of Star Command is an American animated science fiction/adventure/comedy series produced by Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Television Animation. This series was the first hand-drawn animated project by Pixar. The series aired on UPN and ABC from October 2000 to January 2001 as part of Disney's One Saturday Morning and Disney's One Too programming blocks. It is the first series to be based on a Pixar franchise, followed by Forky Asks a Question (debuted on Disney+ in 2019) and Monsters at Work (set to debut on Disney+ in 2021).
The series follows the adventures of Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear, who first appeared as an action figure in the 1995 film Toy Story. It is preceded by the direct-to-video film Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins, which was also aired as the first three episodes of the series. A video game of the same name based on the series was released in 2000.
