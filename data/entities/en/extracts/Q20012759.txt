The Republicans (French: Les RÃ©publicains; LR) is a centre-right, Gaullist, conservative political party in France.
The party was formed on 30 May 2015 by renaming the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party, which had been founded in 2002 under the leadership of former President of France Jacques Chirac. The party used to be one of the two major political parties in the French Fifth Republic along with the centre-left Socialist Party (PS), and, following the 2017 legislative election, it remains the second largest party in the National Assembly (behind President Macron's REM). LR is a member of the European People's Party, the Centrist Democrat International, and the International Democrat Union.
