The Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett Story is a 2001 television documentary produced by Otmoor Productions for BBC Two's Omnibus series and originally called Syd Barrett: Crazy Diamond (in the US, a slightly modified version aired as Pink Floyd & Syd Barrett in the VH1 Legends series in January 2002). Directed by John Edginton, the film includes interviews with all the Pink Floyd members - Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright - plus the "fifth Pink Floyd", Bob Klose, who left the band in 1965, getting their points of view on the original band founder Syd Barrett. The film includes rare early television appearances of Pink Floyd, and home movies.
The film was first released on DVD on 24 March 2003. In 2006 a new "definitive edition DVD" was produced in the UK and Europe in which the full unedited interviews conducted by the director with Pink Floyd are now made available, alongside the original documentary.
