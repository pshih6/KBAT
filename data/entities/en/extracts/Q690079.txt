Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC ), using the trademark Digital, was a major American company in the computer industry from the 1960s to the 1990s. The company was co-founded by Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson in 1957. Olsen was president until forced to resign in 1992, after the company had gone into precipitous decline.
DEC was a leading vendor of computer systems, including computers, software, and peripherals. Their PDP and successor VAX products were the most successful of all minicomputers in terms of sales.
DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry. At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002.
Some parts of DEC were sold to other companies in order to help fund the mergers; notably the compiler business and the Hudson, Massachusetts facility, were sold to Intel.  
As of 2012, decades-old hardware, including PDP-11, VAX and AlphaServer, is being emulated in order to continue benefitting from software written long ago; funding for this is scheduled to last at least until 2030.
