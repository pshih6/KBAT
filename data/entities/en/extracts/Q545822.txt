Anna Chennault, born Chan Sheng Mai later spelled Chen Xiangmei (陳香梅, actual birth year 1923 but reported as June 23, 1925 – March 30, 2018), also known as Anna Chan Chennault or Anna Chen Chennault, was a war correspondent and prominent Republican member of the US China Lobby. She was married to U.S. WWII aviator Claire Chennault.
Controversy surrounds Anna Chennault for the crucial role she may have played on behalf of the Richard Nixon 1968 presidential campaign in seeking to delay the Vietnam War peace negotiations. Such a delay would boost the chances for Nixon to win the presidential elections. Richard Nixon was not acting on behalf of the US government as of yet, and such interference in the peace process would, when proven, constitute treason according to the Logan Act.
