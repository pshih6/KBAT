Isidora Dolores Ibárruri Gómez (9 December 1895 – 12 November 1989) – known as "La Pasionaria" (English: "the Passionflower") – was a Spanish Republican fighter of the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 and a communist politician of Basque origin, known for her famous slogan ¡No Pasarán! ("They shall not pass") issued during the  Battle for Madrid in November 1936.
She joined the Spanish Communist Party (Spanish: Partido Comunista Español) when it was founded in 1920. In the 1930s she became a writer for the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) publication Mundo Obrero and in February 1936 was elected to the Cortes Generales as a PCE deputy for Asturias. Going into exile from Spain towards the end of the Civil War in 1939, she became General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain, a position she held from 1944 to 1960. The Party then named her honorary president of the PCE, a post she held for the rest of her life. Upon her return to Spain in 1977 she was re-elected as a deputy to the Cortes for the same region she had represented from 1936 to 1939 under the Spanish Second Republic.
