Sebastian Rudolf Karl von Hoerner (15 April 1919 – 7 January 2003) was a German astrophysicist and radio astronomer.
Born in Görlitz, Lower Silesia, he was influential in discussions of SETI. He concluded that civilizations were few and far between and that they would generally not make the effort to engage in interstellar travel.
Hoerner died in Esslingen am Neckar, Baden-Württemberg, at age 83. His daughter, Hanna von Hoerner, was also an astrophysicist.
