Pierre-André Lefaucheux (30 June 1898 – 11 February 1955) was a leading French industrialist and recipient of the Order of Liberation, awarded to heroes of France's Liberation during World War II.
As the first chairman of Renault during the critical years after World War II, Lefaucheux died in an automobile accident in 1955 at age 56 — while directing the development of the forthcoming Renault Dauphine.
Lefaucheux was the subject of the 2009 biography, Patron de Renault, Pierre Lefaucheux (1944-1955) by Cyrille Sardais.
