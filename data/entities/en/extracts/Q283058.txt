Michael Hutchinson (born 20 November 1973 in Northern Ireland) is a British and Irish racing cyclist and writer who has represented Great Britain, Ireland and Northern Ireland at events including the Commonwealth Games.
Hutchinson's speciality is the individual time trial, but he has also won races on the track. He currently (October 2014) holds the competition record for 30 miles and is a previous holder of the 10, 25, 50 and 100-mile records.
He has made two unsuccessful attempts at the hour record, the first of which forms the basis of his 2006 book The Hour, which gained him the award for Best New Writer at the 2007 British Sports Book Awards.
