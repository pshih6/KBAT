Vertigo Records is a record company, which originated in the United Kingdom. It was a subsidiary of the Philips/Phonogram record label, launched in 1969 to specialise in progressive rock and other non-mainstream musical styles.  Today it is operated by Universal Music Germany, and the UK catalog was folded into Mercury Records, which was absorbed in 2013 by Virgin EMI Records.
