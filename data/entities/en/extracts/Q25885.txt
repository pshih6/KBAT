Louise Cathrine Elisabeth Bjørnsen, pen name Elisabeth Martens, (1824–1899) was successful as an early Danish female novelist and short story writer. Following in the footsteps of Mathilde Fibiger, she published her first novel Hvad er Livet? (What is Life?) in 1855, based on her own experiences as a governess. She went on to write five more novels and four collections of short stories.
