Die Another Day is a 2002 spy film and the twentieth film in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions. It was produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, and directed by Lee Tamahori. It is the fourth and final film to star Pierce Brosnan as MI6 agent James Bond; Halle Berry co-stars as NSA agent Jinx Johnson, the Bond girl. The plot follows Bond as he attempts to locate a mole in British intelligence who betrayed him to North Korea and a British billionaire who is later revealed to be seemingly connected to a North Korean operative that he fought against in North Korea. 
The film marked the James Bond franchise's 40th anniversary. Die Another Day includes references to each of the preceding films. The film received mixed reviews; some critics praised Tamahori's direction, but many disliked its over-reliance on CGI, product placement and unoriginal plot, as well as the villain. Many consider it one of the weakest entries in the franchise. Nevertheless, Die Another Day was the highest-grossing James Bond film up to that time unadjusted for inflation.
