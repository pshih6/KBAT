Home Alone 3 is a 1997 American family comedy film written and produced by John Hughes. It is the third film in the Home Alone series and the first not to feature actor Macaulay Culkin and the cast from the previous films, nor director Chris Columbus and composer John Williams. The film is directed by Raja Gosnell (in his directorial debut), who served as the editor of both original films. It stars Alex D. Linz as Alex Pruitt, an 8-year-old child prodigy who defends his home from a dangerous band of criminals who work for a North Korean terrorist organization.
The film was followed by a made-for-television sequel, Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House, in 2002.
