Asselineau has been described as a souverainist but doesn't self-identify as such. He identifies neither as right-wing nor left-wing. Arrêt sur images described his background as "typical of a right wing énarque, bordering on the far-right". His views have also been described by many observers as conspiracy theories.Asselineau has had a troubled relationship with the media, which he has repeatedly accused of "censorship". In his critique he includes French Wikipedia, which has considered him insufficiently noteworthy to justify a page in the encyclopedia. The activism of his supporters to try and increase media coverage of Asselineau and the UPR has been noted by some observers.He ran in the 2017 French presidential election, presenting himself as the “Frexit candidate”. He was eventually eliminated in the first round, earning only 0.92% of the votes.On November 2019 was published a book written by numerous Japanese politicians and intellectuals, as well as French intellectuals such as Emmanuel Todd, and François Asselineau himself.
