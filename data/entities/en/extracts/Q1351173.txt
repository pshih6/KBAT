RTL, formerly Radio Luxembourg, is a French commercial radio network owned by the RTL Group.  Founded in 1933 as Radio Luxembourg, the station's name was changed to RTL in 1966. It broadcast from outside France until 1981, because only public stations had been allowed until then.
It is a general-interest, news, talk and music station, broadcasting nationally ("category E" as classified by the CSA).
