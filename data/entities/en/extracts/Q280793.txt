Kevin Scott Nash (born July 9, 1959) is an American actor and retired professional wrestler, best known for his tenures with World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). He has wrestled under several ring names, but is best known for his work under his real name in WCW, as well as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) and as Diesel in the WWF.
In 1994 while in the WWF, Nash (then known as Diesel) won the WWF World, Intercontinental and Tag Team Championships (the WWF Triple Crown) and at that year's Slammy Awards won the MVP (now Superstar of the Year) and Best Tag Team (now Tag Team of the Year, with Shawn Michaels) awards. Between WWE, WCW, and TNA, Nash has won a total of 21 championships, including being a six-time world champion (five-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion and one-time WWF Champion) and a 12-time world tag team champion between the three promotions. Nash's 358-day WWF Championship reign is the longest of the 1990s. During his time in WCW, Nash became the first wrestler to defeat Goldberg and in the process ended his undefeated streak of 173–0 at Starrcade in 1998. Following a college basketball career for the University of Tennessee, Nash played professionally for German Bundesliga squad Gießen 46ers for a short time until a knee injury ended his career. 
Nash was a member of The Kliq, an influential backstage group that included Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Scott Hall, and Sean Waltman. He is also one of the three founding members of the New World Order (nWo), along with Hulk Hogan and Scott Hall. Nash was inducted individually into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2015, and he will be inducted for the second time in 2020 as a member of the New World Order alongside Hogan, Hall, and Waltman.
