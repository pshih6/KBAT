Antilles Records was a record label founded as a division of Island Records. It began as a jazz label, recording Joanne Brackeen, Biréli Lagrène, and Phil Woods,  though its catalogue did expand to include eclectic musicians like Brian Eno and Robert Fripp. It was the first to introduce the Slits and Nick Drake to American audiences. One of its founders was Jeff Walker, an employee at Island and the first A&R director for Antilles.In the 1990s, Antilles recorded Peter Apfelbaum, Johnny Griffin, Frank Morgan, Steve Turre, and Randy Weston. Polygram bought Island, Seagram's bought Polygram, and by the end of the decade Antilles stopped recording jazz.
