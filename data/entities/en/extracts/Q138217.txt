Gaius Julius C. f. L. n. Iulus was a Roman statesman, who held the consulship in 482 BC.  After a contentious election, he was chosen to represent the more moderate faction in Roman politics, while his colleague, Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, was elected by the aristocratic party.  Both consuls led a Roman army against Veii, but withdrew when the Veientes refused to confront them.  Thirty years later, in 451, Julius was chosen a member of the first decemvirate, alongside several other ex-consuls and other respected statesmen.  Julius proved himself a man of good judgment and integrity, and helped to draw up the first ten tables of Roman law.
