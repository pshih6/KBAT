Luciano Pigozzi, also known professionally as Alan Collins (10 January 1927 â€“ 14 June 2008), was an Italian character actor. A long-time staple of Italian genre cinema, Pigozzi was noted for his resemblance to Peter Lorre and appeared in such films as Human Cobras, Yor, the Hunter from the Future, Ivanhoe, the Norman Swordsman, Blood and Black Lace, Libido and perhaps his goriest role in Baron Blood.
Born in Novellara, province of Reggio Emilia, in Italy; he appeared in more than one hundred films between 1954 and 1989, including many 1960s Italian thrillers such as Terror-Creatures from the Grave, Werewolf in a Girls' Dormitory and The Whip and the Body. Pigozzi died in 2008, at age 81.
