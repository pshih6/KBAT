Saint Tydfil (Welsh: Tudful; martyred c.â€‰480) is the legendary dedicatee of Merthyr Tydfil, Wales.According to legend, Tydfil was the twenty-third daughter of Brychan, king of Brycheiniog, by his fourth wife. She was murdered with her brother Rhu in Merthyr Tydfil, by either Welsh or Saxon pagans, and buried in the town. Her holy well Ffrynnon Dudfel, seems to have disappeared.
Llysworney Church in the Vale of Glamorgan is dedicated to this female saint, as was a chape of Llantwit Major until it was given to the Abbey of Tewkesbury.
