Sebald Heyden (18 December 1499 â€“ 9 July 1561) was a German musicologist, cantor, theologian, hymn-writer and religious poet. He is perhaps best known for his De arte canendi ("On the Art of Singing", third installment published 1540) which is considered to have had a major impact on scholarship and the teaching of singing to young boys. It has been speculated that Heyden was the world's first true musicologist.
