The Silent Scream, popularly released under the truncated title, Silent Scream, is a 1979 American slasher film directed by Denny Harris, and starring Rebecca Balding, Cameron Mitchell, Barbara Steele and Yvonne De Carlo. The film follows a college student who finds rooming in a hilltop boarding house where a homicidal killer is on the loose.
Released regionally in November 1979, The Silent Scream performed favorably at the box office, which prompted American Cinema Releasing to expand its release in January 1980. It went on to become one of the most financially successful independent horror films of the 1970s.
