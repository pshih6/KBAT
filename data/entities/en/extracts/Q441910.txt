Arthur Jensen (9 November 1897 – 28 November 1981) was a Danish actor whose career lasted for almost 60 years. He made his début on stage at the Royal Danish Theatre in 1923, and he had his big screen début in the silent film Pas på pigerne in 1930.
Today he is arguably best known for his roles as superintendent Meyer in the TV-series Huset på Christianshavn and as Hr. Schwann in the TV-series Matador in the 1970s.
