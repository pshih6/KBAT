The Diary of Miss Idilia: A Tragic Tale of Young Love Lost is a book edited by Genevieve Hill. It presents itself to be the original diary of a young girl who disappeared whilst on holiday with her parents in the German Rhineland in 1851. 
First published under the title  Das verschwundene Mädchen : die Aufzeichnungen der Idilia Dubb (The missing girl: the records of Idilia Dubb) by Bertelsmann in München in 2002, the diary was later translated into Dutch by Mistral in 2009, and published in English by Short Books in 2010. 
The authenticity of the diary and the historicity of the events described in it have been challenged.
