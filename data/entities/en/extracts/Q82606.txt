Pembroke College is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England, located in Pembroke Square. The college was founded in 1624 by King James I of England, using in part the endowment of merchant Thomas Tesdale, and was named after William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, Lord Chamberlain and then-Chancellor of the University.Like many of Oxford's colleges, Pembroke admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979, having previously accepted men only. As of 2018, Pembroke had an estimated financial endowment of £58.5 million. Pembroke offers the study of almost all the courses offered by the university.
Dame Lynne Brindley, former head of the British Library, has been Master of the College since 2013. She will be stepping down at the end of the 2019–2020 academic year. In July 2020, Sir Ernest Ryder, a former Lord Justice of Appeal, will take on the role.
