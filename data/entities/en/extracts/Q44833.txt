John Weldon "J. J." Cale (December 5, 1938 â€“ July 26, 2013) was an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Though he avoided the limelight, his influence as a musical artist has been widely acknowledged by figures such as Mark Knopfler, Neil Young and Eric Clapton, who described him as "one of the most important artists in the history of rock". He is considered to be one of the originators of the Tulsa Sound, a loose genre drawing on blues, rockabilly, country, and jazz.
In 2008, Cale, along with Clapton, received a Grammy Award for their album The Road to Escondido.
