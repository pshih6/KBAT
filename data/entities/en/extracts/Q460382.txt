No√© Jitrik was born in Argentina in 1928 and is one of Latin America's foremost literary critics. 
He is director of the Instituto de literatura hispanoamericana at the University of Buenos Aires, and was a notable participant in the cultural journal Contorno in the 1950s in Argentina.  
While originally enamored of the work of Jorge Luis Borges he became convinced that Borges had nothing new to write after the publication of El hacedor in 1960 and his unfavorable criticism of Borges slowly became what he could only term "complex" in an article in 1981 in Les Temps Modernes.
