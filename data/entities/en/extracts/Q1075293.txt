Irish Americans (Irish: Gael-Mheiriceánaigh) are an ethnic group comprising Americans who have full or partial ancestry from Ireland. About 33 million Americans — 10.1% of the total population — self-identified as being of Irish ancestry in the 2017 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. This compares with a population of 6.8 million on the island of Ireland. In contrast to Ireland, surveys since the 1970s have shown consistent majorities or pluralities of Americans who self-identify as being of Irish ancestry as also self-identifying as being Protestant, and are actually mostly Scotch-Irish, the American descendants of Ulster Protestants (mostly Ulster Scots) who emigrated from Ireland to the United States en masse from the early 18th century through the early 1920s.Three million people separately self-identified as Scotch-Irish, but demographers have long assumed the U.S. Census Bureau self-identification estimate of the Scotch-Irish to be a serious undercount (in part, because along with English and other British ancestries, many Scotch-Irish self-identify as being of "American ancestry"). While some argue that the Scotch-Irish should be considered Irish, considering that conversions by Irish Catholics during the Reformation in Ireland to Protestant churches were historically rare, and that intermarriage between Protestants and Catholics in both Ireland and in the United States was also historically rare while interethnic and interdenominational marriage amongst Protestants in Ulster was relatively common, multiple historians have argued instead that the "Scotch-Irish" distinction remains necessary as the Ulster Protestants remain a distinct ethnoreligious group from the Irish Catholics.
