DCD2 Records, formerly known as Decaydance Records, is an independent record label owned by Patrick Stump and Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy and partners, based in New York City. It was founded as an imprint of Fueled by Ramen. The first band Wentz signed to the label was Panic! at the Disco. In 2014, the label relaunched as DCD2 Records, keeping the acts that were still signed to Decaydance before the relaunch. New Politics and Lolo were the first acts signed under the new name.
