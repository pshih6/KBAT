Neue Deutsche HÃ¤rte (which means new German hardness in English), otherwise known as NDH, Tanzmetall and dance-metal, is a sub-genre of rock music that developed in Germany and Austria during the early and mid-1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Alluding to the style of Neue Deutsche Welle, the term was coined by the music press after the 1995 release of the German rock and metal band Rammstein's first studio album Herzeleid.
