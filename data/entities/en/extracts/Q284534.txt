Father Leonard Edward Feeney (February 18, 1897 â€“ January 30, 1978) was an American Jesuit priest, poet, lyricist, and essayist.
He articulated a particular interpretation of the Roman Catholic doctrine extra Ecclesiam nulla salus ("outside the Church there is no salvation"). He took the position that baptism of blood and baptism of desire are unavailing and that therefore no non-Catholics will be saved. Fighting against what he perceived to be the liberalization of Catholic doctrine, he came under ecclesiastical censure. He was described as Boston's homegrown version of Father Charles Coughlin for his antisemitism.
