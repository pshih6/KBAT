Leon Ames (born Harry Wycoff; January 20, 1902 â€“ October 12, 1993) was an American film and television actor. He is best remembered for playing father figures in such films as Meet Me in St. Louis (1944) with Judy Garland as one of his daughters, Little Women (1949), On Moonlight Bay (1951), and By the Light of the Silvery Moon (1953). The fathers whom Ames portrayed were often somewhat stuffy and exasperated by the younger generation, but ultimately kind and understanding. One of his best-known roles was as DA Kyle Sackett in the film, The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946).
