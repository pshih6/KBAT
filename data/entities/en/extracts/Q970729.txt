O Globo (Portuguese pronunciation: [u ˈɡlobu], The Globe) is a Brazilian newspaper based in Rio de Janeiro. O Globo is the most prominent print publication in the Grupo Globo media conglomerate, which includes globo.com, which is the top 5 website in Brazil and top 134 worldwide.Founded by journalist Irineu Marinho, owner of A Noite, it was originally intended as a morning daily to extend the newspaper interests of the company. In time, it became the flagship paper of the group. When Irineu died weeks after the founding of the newspaper in 1925, it was inherited by his son Roberto. At age 21, he started working as a trainee reporter for the paper and later became managing editor.
Roberto Marinho developed Grupo Globo (the conglomerate of media companies consisting of O Globo, Rede Globo, Rádio Globo, Editora Globo and other subsidiaries) as Brazil's largest media group, entering radio in the 1940s and TV in the 1960s, and picking up other interests.
