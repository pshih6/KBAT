Gaspard-Félix Tournachon (6 April 1820 – 20 March 1910), known by the mononymous pseudonym Nadar, was a French photographer, caricaturist, journalist, novelist, balloonist, and proponent of manned flight.  In 1858 he became the first person to take aerial photographs.
Photographic portraits by Nadar are held by many of the great national collections of photographs. His son, Paul Nadar, continued the studio after his death.
