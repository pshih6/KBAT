Evelyn John St Loe Strachey (21 October 1901 â€“ 15 July 1963) was a British Labour politician and writer.
A journalist by profession, Strachey was elected to Parliament in 1929. He was initially a disciple of Oswald Mosley, and, feeling that the Second Labour Government was not doing enough to combat unemployment, joined Mosley in founding the New Party in 1931. He broke with Mosley later in the year, so did not follow him into fascism. Strachey lost his seat in 1931 and was a communist sympathiser for the rest of the 1930s, before breaking with the Communist Party in 1940.
During the Second World War Strachey served as a Royal Air Force officer, in planning and public relations roles. He was once again elected to Parliament as a Labour MP in 1945, and held office under Clement Attlee as Minister of Food (he became an unpopular figure because of food rationing) and as Secretary of State for War. He continued to be a Labour MP, generally as a supporter of the party's right until his death in 1963.
Throughout his career Strachey was a prolific writer of books and articles, writing from a communist perspective in the 1930s and then as a social democrat after the Second World War.
