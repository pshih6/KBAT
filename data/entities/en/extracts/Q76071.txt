Julius Faucher (13 June 1820 in Berlin â€“ 12 June 1878 in Rome) was a German journalist and a significant advocate of liberalism and free trade. He was one of the first to advocate privatizing the security functions of the state, which would eliminate taxation, therefore coming up with "a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism".
