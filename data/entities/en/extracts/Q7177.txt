Jean-Marie Le Pen (French pronunciation: ​[ʒɑ̃ ma.ʁi lə.pɛn]; born 20 June 1928) is a French politician who served as President of the National Front from 1972 to 2011. He also served as Honorary President of the National Front from 2011 to 2018.
He graduated from faculty of law in Paris in 1949. After his time in the military, he studied political science and law at Panthéon-Assas University.
Le Pen focuses on issues related to immigration to France, the European Union, traditional culture and values, law and order and France's high rate of unemployment. His progression in the 1980s is known as the "lepénisation of spirits" due to its noticeable effect on mainstream political opinion. His controversial speeches and his integration into public life have made him a figure who polarizes opinion, considered as the "Devil of the Republic" among his opponents or as the "last samurai in politics" among his supporters.
His longevity in politics and his five attempts to become President of France have made him a major figure in French political life. His progress to the second round in the 2002 presidential election left its mark on French public life and the "21st of April" is now a frequently used expression in France. A former Member of the European Parliament (MEP), he served as the Honorary President of the National Front from 2011 to 2018. He was expelled from the party by his daughter Marine Le Pen in 2015, after new controversial statements.
