Globe (グローブ, Gurōbu, also styled as globe) were a dance-oriented Japanese pop band, formed in 1995 by producer and songwriter Tetsuya Komuro. Originally consisting of Komuro, Keiko Yamada and Marc Panther, the group's singles consistently hit the charts. In late 2002 Yoshiki, drummer and pianist for X Japan, joined the group, but he left the band about a year later.
Their 1996 debut album, Globe, sold over 4 million copies, and their 1998 single "wanna Be A Dreammaker" won the grand prix award at the 40th Japan Record Awards, the Japanese record industry's highest honor. Komuro also mentioned there will be some collaboration work with other artists with the artist title of Globe Featuring, and Globe Extreme for collaborations with Yoshiki.
