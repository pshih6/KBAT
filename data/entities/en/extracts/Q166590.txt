César Aira (Argentine Spanish: [ˈse.saɾ ˈai.ɾa]; born 23 February 1949 in Coronel Pringles, Buenos Aires Province) is an Argentinian writer and translator, and an exponent of contemporary Argentinian literature.  Aira has published over a hundred short books of stories, novels and essays.  In fact, at least since 1993 a hallmark of his work is a truly frenetic level of writing and publication—two to five novella-length books each year.  He has lectured at the University of Buenos Aires, on Copi and Arthur Rimbaud, and at the University of Rosario on Constructivism and Stéphane Mallarmé, and has translated and edited books from France, England, Italy, Brazil, Spain, Mexico, and Venezuela.
