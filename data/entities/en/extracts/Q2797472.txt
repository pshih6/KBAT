Leslie Lynch King Sr. (July 25, 1884 â€“ February 18, 1941) was the biological father of U.S. President Gerald Ford. Because of his alcoholism and abusive behavior, his wife, Dorothy Gardner, left him sixteen days after Ford's birth. King is believed to have seen him only once, while Ford was in high school.
