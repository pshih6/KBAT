Carl William Ackerman (January 16, 1890 in Richmond, Indiana â€“ October 9, 1970 in New York City) was an American journalist, author and educational administrator, the first dean of the Columbia School of Journalism. In 1919, as a correspondent of the Public Ledger of Philadelphia, he published the first excerpts of an English translation of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, but changed the text so that it appeared to be a Bolshevist tract. 
In 1931, he was appointed as the director of the journalism department, succeeding John William Cunliffe, and became the first dean of the newly established graduate School of Journalism program at Columbia University. He was instrumental in developing the school through its first two decades, as he served in that position until 1954.
