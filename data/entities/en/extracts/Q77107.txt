Ulrich von Hutten (21 April 1488 â€“ 29 August 1523) was a German scholar, poet and satirist, who later became a follower of Martin Luther and a Protestant reformer.
By 1519, he was an outspoken critic of the Roman Catholic Church. Hutten was a bridge between the Renaissance humanists and the Lutheran Reformation.
He was a leader of the Imperial Knights of the Holy Roman Empire along with Franz von Sickingen. Both were the leaders in the Knights' Revolt.
