Seinen manga (青年漫画) are manga marketed toward young adult men. In Japanese, the word "seinen" literally means "youth," but the term "seinen manga" is also used to describe the target audience of comics like Weekly Manga Times and Weekly Manga Goraku which are aimed at men from their 20s to their 50s. Seinen manga are distinguished from shōnen manga which are for younger teen boys, although some seinen manga like xxxHolic share some similarities with shōnen manga. Seinen manga can focus on action, politics, science fiction, fantasy, relationships, sports, or comedy. The female equivalent to seinen manga is josei manga.
Seinen manga have a wide variety of art styles and variation in subject matter. Examples of seinen series include: 20th Century Boys, Berserk, Excel Saga, Ghost in the Shell, Hellsing, Initial D, Mushishi, Oh My Goddess!, One-Punch Man, Outlaw Star, Tokyo Ghoul, and the formerly shōnen manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and Trigun.
A common way to tell if a manga is seinen is by looking at whether furigana is used over the original kanji text: if there are furigana on all kanji, the title is generally aimed at a younger audience. The title of the magazine it was published in is also an important indicator. Usually Japanese manga magazines with the word "young" in the title (Weekly Young Jump for instance) are seinen. There are also mixed shōnen/seinen magazines such as Gangan Powered and Comp Ace. Other popular seinen manga magazines include Weekly Young Magazine, Weekly Young Sunday, Big Comic Spirits, Business Jump, Ultra Jump, and Afternoon.
