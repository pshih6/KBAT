Fellini's Casanova (Il Casanova di Federico Fellini) is a 1976 Italian film by director Federico Fellini, adapted from the autobiography of Giacomo Casanova, the 18th-century adventurer and writer.
Shot entirely at the Cinecitt√† studios in Rome, the film won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design, with the Oscar going to Danilo Donati.
The film portrays Casanova's life as a journey into sexual abandonment. The narrative presents Casanova's adventures in a detached, methodical fashion, as the respect for which he yearns is constantly undermined by his more basic urges.
