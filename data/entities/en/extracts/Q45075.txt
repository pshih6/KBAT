Sebastian Kneipp (17 May 1821, Stephansried, Germany – 17 June 1897, in Bad Wörishofen) was a Bavarian priest and one of the forefathers of the naturopathic medicine movement. He is most commonly associated with the "Kneipp Cure" form of hydrotherapy, the application of water through various methods, temperatures and pressures which he claimed to have therapeutic or healing effects, thus building several hospitals in Bad Wörishofen.
Although most commonly associated with one area of Nature Cure, Kneipp was the proponent of an entire system of healing which rested on five main tenets:
Hydrotherapy – The use of water to treat ailments
Phytotherapy – The use of botanical medicines was another of Kneipp's specialities
Exercise – Promoting health of the body through movement
Nutrition – A wholesome diet of whole grains, fruits & vegetables with limited meat.
Balance – Kneipp believed that a healthy mind begot a healthy person
