The Moderate Party (Spanish: Partido Moderado) or Moderate Liberal Party (Spanish: Partido Liberal Moderado) was one of the two Spanish political parties that contended for power during the reign of Isabel II (reigned 1833â€“1868). Like the opposing Progressive Party (Spanish: Partido Progresista), they characterized themselves as liberal and dynasticist: that is, both parties supported Isabel against the claims of the right-wing Carlists. The Moderates contained various factions. Some supported working with Progressives while others sought closer ties with the Old Regime, though the party's dominant ideology was adherence to the centrist juste milieu of the French Doctrinaires.
