Dawn Records was an American record label. It was founded as a subsidiary of Seeco Records in 1954 and was run by Sidney Siegel.
Dawn first started issuing albums in the mid-1950s, releasing primarily jazz, but also pop, R&B, and folk revival material. While it was active only for a few years, it released a number of significant jazz releases. Its holdings were bought later by Biograph Records and then by Fresh Sound Records, both of which reissued much of its catalog on CD.
