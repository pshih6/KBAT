Fry finds work at an interplanetary delivery company, working alongside the one-eyed Turanga Leela and robot Bender Bending Rodriguez. The series was envisioned by Groening in the mid-1990s while working on The Simpsons; he brought David X. Cohen aboard to develop storylines and characters to pitch the show to Fox.
