Ronald Lynn Ramsey (; born November 20, 1955) is an American auctioneer, politician and lobbyist who served as the 49th Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee and Speaker of the State Senate from 2007 to 2017.  A Republican from Blountville in East Tennessee, Ramsey succeeded long-term Democratic Lieutenant Governor John S. Wilder in 2007, who had held the office of Lieutenant Governor since 1971.
Tennesseans do not elect their lieutenant governor; rather, the Speaker of the Senate, who is first in the line of succession to the governor, is granted the title by statute.
Ron Ramsey announced that he would not seek re-election in 2016, and would instead retire from politics. State Representative Jon Lundberg (R-Bristol) won the primary election on August 4, 2016 to take Ramsey's seat.
