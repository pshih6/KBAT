A weather presenter (also known colloquially in North America as a weatherman or weather broadcaster) is a person who presents the weather forecast daily on radio, television or internet news broadcasts. Using diverse tools, such as projected weather maps, they inform the viewers of the current and future weather conditions, explain the reasons underlying this evolution, and relaying to the public any weather hazards and warnings issued for their region, country or larger areas. There is no basic qualifications to become a weather presenter, depending on the country and the media, it can range from an introduction to meteorology for a television host to a diploma in meteorology from a recognized university. So it is not to be confused with meteorologist, or weather forecaster, the holder of a diploma in meteorology.
