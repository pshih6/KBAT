James Brewer (October 3, 1920 – June 3, 1988), also known as Blind Jim Brewer (although Brewer did not like this additive: "My mother didn't name me "Blind", she named me "Jim"), was an American blues singer and guitarist.
Born in Brookhaven, Mississippi, he moved to Chicago, Illinois in the 1940s spending the latter part of his life busking and performing both blues and religious songs at blues and folk festivals, on Chicago’s Maxwell Street and other venues.
