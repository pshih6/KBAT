Thomas Malcolm Muggeridge (24 March 1903 â€“ 14 November 1990) was an English journalist and satirist. His father was a prominent socialist politician and one of the early Labour Party Members of Parliament (for Romford in Essex). In his twenties, Muggeridge was attracted to communism but after living in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, he became a forceful anti-communist. During the Second World War he worked for the British government as a soldier and a spy, first in East Africa for two years and then in Paris. In the aftermath of the war, under the influence of Hugh Kingsmill and as a hugely influential London journalist, he converted to Christianity and helped bring Mother Teresa to popular attention in the West. He was also a critic of the sexual revolution and of drug use. Muggeridge kept detailed diaries for much of his life (published in 1981 under the title Like It Was: The Diaries of Malcolm Muggeridge) and developed these into two volumes of a critically acclaimed and uncompleted autobiography Chronicles of Wasted Time.
