Asa F. Martin (June 25, 1900 â€“ August 15, 1979) was an American old time musician, singer and guitarist who made many recordings during the 1920s and 1930s and was closely associated with renowned fiddle player Doc Roberts, for whom he played rhythm guitar. In turn, Roberts frequently played mandolin on Martin's recordings; Roberts' son James also sang duets with Martin under the name "Doc Roberts Trio".
