Anshan (Chinese: 鞍山; pinyin: Ānshān; literally: 'saddle mountain') is an inland prefecture-level city in central-southeast Liaoning province, People's Republic of China, about 92 kilometres (57 mi) south of the provincial capital Shenyang.  It is Liaoning's third-most populous city with a population of 3,584,000 people, and covers an area of about 9,252 km2 (3,572 sq mi) spanning 133 km (83 mi) from east to the west.  The city's name came from the horse saddle-like shape of a nearby mountain south of the city, which can be seen on the left (west) about five minutes before the northbound train arrives at Anshan railway station.  Anshan is home to the Anshan Iron and Steel Group, one of the largest steel producers in China.  Anshan is sister city with Sheffield, United Kingdom.
Anshan had a population of 3.65 million at the 2010 census.  The built-up area encompassing four Anshan urban districts (1,529,350 inhabitants) and urban Liaoyang was home to more than 2.17 million inhabitants in 2010.
Anshan holds one-third of the world's supply of talcum and a quarter of the world's reserves of magnesite.  Anshan also produced the largest ever jade stone, now a local tourist attraction carved as a Buddha statue.
