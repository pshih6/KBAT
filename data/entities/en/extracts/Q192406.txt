The Communist Party of Greece (Greek: Κομμουνιστικό Κόμμα Ελλάδας, Kommounistikó Kómma Elládas, KKE) is a Marxist–Leninist political party in Greece. 
Founded in 1918 as the Socialist Labour Party of Greece (adopting its current name in November 1924), it is the oldest political party in modern Greek politics. The party was banned in 1936, but played a significant role in the Greek resistance and the Greek Civil War, and its membership peaked in the mid-1940s. Legalization of the KKE was restored following the fall of the Greek military junta of 1967–1974.
The party has returned MPs in all elections since then, and took part in a coalition government in 1989 when it got more than 13% of the vote.
