Félix Fénéon (22 June 1861 – 29 February 1944) was a French anarchist and art critic during the late 19th century. He coined the term "Neo-Impressionism" in 1886 to identify a group of artists led by Georges Seurat, and ardently promoted them.
The Fénéon Prize was established in 1949 by his wife based on proceeds from the sale of his art collection.
