Super Junior-M (stylized as SJ-M), an initialism for Super Junior-Mandarin, is a Chinese sub-unit of the South Korean boy band Super Junior. The sub-unit is the first international music group in the Chinese music industry to have members of both Chinese and Korean descent.Formed in 2008 by South Korea's S.M. Entertainment, Super Junior-M became the third and most successful subgroup branched off from the Korean band Super Junior. The sub-unit originally consisted of leader Han Geng, Donghae, Siwon, Ryeowook, Kyuhyun and two additional members appearing exclusively to the subgroup, Zhou Mi and Henry. In December 2009, Han Geng filed a lawsuit against S.M. Entertainment and decided to leave the main group and sub-unit, resulting in the sub-unit's temporary disbandment.After a year-long hiatus, Super Junior-M returned with addition Super Junior members Eunhyuk and Sungmin. They released Super Junior-M's second mini album Perfection in February 2011. After Han Geng's leave, the group considers Sungmin as the new "leader", as he is the oldest member of the team. However, S.M. Entertainment has not released any statements about electing a new group leader.
On April 30, 2018, Label SJ released a statement announcing Henry's departure from the group, leaving Zhoumi as the only Chinese member.
