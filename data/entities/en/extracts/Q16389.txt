Sir Charles Kuen Kao  (4 November 1933 â€“ 23 September 2018) was a physicist and electrical engineer who pioneered the development and use of fibre optics in telecommunications. In the 1960s, Kao created various methods to combine glass fibres with lasers in order to transmit digital data, which laid the groundwork for the evolution of the Internet.
Known as the "Godfather of Broadband", the "Father of Fiber Optics", and the "Father of Fiber Optic Communications", Kao was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics for "groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibers for optical communication".Born in Shanghai, Kao was a permanent resident of Hong Kong and held citizenships in the United Kingdom and the United States.
