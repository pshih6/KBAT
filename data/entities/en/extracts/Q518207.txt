Jean-Paul Aron (27 May 1925 - 20 August 1988) was a French writer, philosopher and journalist. His most notable work is Les Modernes, which was published in 1984.
Aron was born in Strasbourg.  He was a close friend of Michel Foucault in the early 1950s, before a falling out over a lover. He was, like Foucault, an early person of renown in France to die of AIDS, and is widely credited for giving the disease a human face and challenging the public perception of the disease. During his lifetime, he published several historical works that examined middle-class social practices. He is buried at 6, rue du Repos in Paris.
