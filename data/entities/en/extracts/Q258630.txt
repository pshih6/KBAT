Sophie Calle (born 9 October 1953) is a French writer, photographer, installation artist, and conceptual artist.

Her photographic work often includes panels of text of her own writing.Since 2005 Calle has taught as a professor of film and photography at European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. She has lectured at the University of California, San Diego in the Visual Arts Department. She has also taught at Mills College in Oakland, California.
