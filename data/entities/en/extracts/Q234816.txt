Christine de Pizan or Pisan (French pronunciation: [kʁistin də pizɑ̃] (listen)), born Cristina da Pizzano (1364 – c. 1430), was a poet and author at the court of King Charles VI of France. She is best remembered for defending women in The Book of the City of Ladies and The Treasure of the City of Ladies. Venetian by birth, Christine was a prominent moralist and political thinker in medieval France. Christine's patrons included dukes Louis I of Orleans, Philip the Bold, and John the Fearless. Her books of advice to princesses, princes, and knights remained in print until the 16th century.
In recent decades, Christine's work has been returned to prominence by the efforts of scholars such as Charity Cannon Willard, Earl Jeffrey Richards, Suzanne Solente, Mathilde Laigle and Marie-Josephe Pinet
