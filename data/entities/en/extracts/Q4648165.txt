A. Maceo Walker (June 7, 1909 â€“ June 8, 1994) was an African-American businessman who led expansion of the Universal Life Insurance Company, founded by his father Joseph Edison Walker in Memphis, Tennessee. Together with his father in 1946, he founded the Tri-State Bank of Memphis, still a going concern.
Before joining his father full-time in the business, Walker earned master's degrees in business and actuarial science. When he started work in 1935, he was the only black actuary in Tennessee.
