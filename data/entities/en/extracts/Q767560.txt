The Italian Republican Party (Italian: Partito Repubblicano Italiano, PRI) is a liberal and social-liberal political party in Italy. Founded in 1895, the PRI is the oldest political party still active in Italy.
The PRI has old roots and a long history that began with a left-wing position, claiming descent from the political thought of Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi. The early PRI was also known for its anti-clerical, anti-monarchist republican and later anti-fascist stances. While maintaining the latter three traits, during the second half of the 20th century the party moved slowly to the centre of the political spectrum, becoming increasingly economically liberal. As such, the PRI was a member of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR) from 1976 to 2010.
After 1949 the party was a member of the pro-NATO alliance formed also by Christian Democrats, Democratic Socialists and Liberals, enabling it to participate in most governments of the 1950s. In 1963 the PRI helped bring together the Christian Democrats and the Italian Socialist Party. Although small in terms of voter support, it was an important opinion leader, as articulated by Eugenio Chiesa, Giovanni Conti, Cipriano Facchinetti, Ugo La Malfa and Bruno Visentini.
