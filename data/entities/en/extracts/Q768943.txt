Jean-Charles Houzeau de Lehaie (October 7, 1820 â€“ July 12, 1888) was a Belgian astronomer and journalist. He moved to New Orleans after getting in trouble for his politics in Belgium. In the U.S. he continued his journalistic, astronomical, and political pursuits. He was an abolitionist and joined with unionists before the war in Texas. He worked with Louis Charles Roudanez at a newspaper in New Orleans, before living in Jamaica for a while, receiving reinstatement from an observatory in Brussels and returning to Europe. He came back to Texas for an astronomical event. He published stirring accounts of his adventures and contacts during his travels as well as several works on astronomical subjects.
