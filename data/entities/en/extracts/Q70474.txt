He was a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany.
His father was Hans-Georg von Friedeburg, Commander-in-chief of the Kriegsmarine. During the last year of World War II, Ludwig von Friedeburg became the youngest U-Boat-commander of Germany ever during war periods, aged only 20. He served as commander of U-155 and U-4710.
