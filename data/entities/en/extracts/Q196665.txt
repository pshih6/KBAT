8 Mile is a 2002 American hip-hop musical film written by Scott Silver, directed by Curtis Hanson, and starring Eminem, Mekhi Phifer, Brittany Murphy, Michael Shannon, Anthony Mackie, and Kim Basinger. The film follows white rapper B-Rabbit (Eminem) and his attempt to launch a career in a genre dominated by African-Americans. The title is derived from 8 Mile Road, the highway between the predominantly black city of Detroit and the largely white suburban communities to the north. 8 Mile, which contains autobiographical elements from Eminem's life, was a critical and commercial success. Eminem won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for "Lose Yourself", which has become one of his signature tracks.
