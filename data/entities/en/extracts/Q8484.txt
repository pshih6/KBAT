The Lycée du Parc is a public secondary school located in the sixth arrondissement of Lyon, France. Its name comes from the Parc de la Tête d'Or, one of Europe's largest urban parks, which is situated nearby.
It provides a lycée-level education and also offers classes préparatoires, or prépas, preparing students for entrance to the elite Grandes Écoles such as Ecole Polytechnique, Centrale Paris, ESSEC Business school or HEC Paris.
The school was built on the cite of the former Lunette des Charpennes, part of the Ceintures de Lyon system of fortifications built in the 19th century.
