Imre Ungár (23 January 1909, in Budapest – 22 November 1972, in Budapest) was a Hungarian pianist.
He was blind since the age of three. While a student under István Thomán at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music he won the Competition for Young Talents, beginning a concert career through Hungary. He took part in the II Fryderyk Chopin Competition, tying with Russian émigré Alexander Uninsky for the 1st prize. Uninsky won the coin flipping.
After World War II, which he spent in the Netherlands, Ungár combined his concert career with teaching at the Liszt Academy.
