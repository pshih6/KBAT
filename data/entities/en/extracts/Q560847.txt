James Harris "Jim" Simons (; born April 25, 1938) is an American mathematician,       billionaire hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is known as a quantitative investor and in 1982 founded Renaissance Technologies, a private hedge fund based in Setauket-East Setauket, New York. Due to the success of Renaissance in general and its Medallion Fund in particular, Simons has been described as the greatest investor on Wall Street.

Simons is known for his studies on pattern recognition. He also developed (with Shiing-Shen Chern) the Chernâ€“Simons form, and contributed to the development of string theory by providing a theoretical framework to combine geometry and topology with quantum field theory. From 1968 to 1978, Simons was a mathematics professor and chairman of the mathematics department at Stony Brook University.In 1994, Simons founded the Simons Foundation with his wife to support researches in mathematics and fundamental sciences. He is one of the biggest donors to the University of California, Berkeley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute where he also serves as a member of Board of Trustees, and established the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at Berkeley in 2012. In 2016, asteroid 6618 Jimsimons, discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1936, was named after Simons by the International Astronomical Union in honor of his contributions to mathematics and philanthropy.
