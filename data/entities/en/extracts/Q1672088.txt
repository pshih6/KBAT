Moses the Lawgiver, transmitted in 1973 and 1974, is a 6-hour Italian / British television miniseries which starred Burt Lancaster as Moses. It was an ITC/RAI co-production, filmed in Rome and on location in Israel and Morocco.
Many of the writers, cast members, and crew members of Moses the Lawgiver contributed to another Biblical coproduction by ITC/RAI--the ambitious miniseries Jesus of Nazareth, which was transmitted three years later, in 1977.
