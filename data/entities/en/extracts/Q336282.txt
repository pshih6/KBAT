Frederick Allan "Rick" Moranis (; born April 18, 1953), is a Canadian actor, comedian, screenwriter, and musician. He appeared in the sketch comedy series Second City Television (SCTV) in the 1980s and several Hollywood films, including Strange Brew (1983), Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters II (1989), Little Shop of Horrors (1986), Spaceballs (1987), Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989, and its 1992 and 1997 sequels), Parenthood (1989), My Blue Heaven (1990), and The Flintstones (1994).
In 1997, Moranis began a long break from acting to dedicate his time to his two children as a widower. He wouldn't appear in a live-action film for decades thereafter, although he provided voice-over work for a few animated films, notably Disney's Brother Bear (2003) and also released comedy albums and made appearances at fan conventions. Following his nearly 23 year hiatus from live-action films, it was confirmed in early 2020 that Moranis has signed on to appear in a new sequel to Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.
