Ernst Ottwalt (13 November 1901 â€“ 24 August 1943) was the pen name of German writer and playwright Ernst Gottwalt Nicolas. A communist,  he fled Nazi Germany in 1934 and went into exile in the Soviet Union, where he fell victim to the Great Purge and died in a Soviet gulag. Later, when the Allies of World War II prosecuted Nazi war criminals in the Nuremberg Trials, the chief prosecutor from the Soviet Union quoted from an anti-Nazi book by Ottwalt.
