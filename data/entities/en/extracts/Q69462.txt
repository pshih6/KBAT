Catherine of Mecklenburg (1487 – 6 June 1561, Torgau), Duchess of Saxony, was the daughter of the Duke Magnus II of Mecklenburg and Sophie of Pomerania-Stettin.  She married on 6 July 1512 in Freiberg Duke Henry the Pious of Saxony.  The couple had six children:

Sibylle (1515–1592)married in 1540 Duke Francis I of Saxe-Lauenburg (1510–1581)Aemilia (1516–1591)married in 1533 Margrave George the Pious of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1484–1534)Sidonie (1518–1575)married in 1545 Duke Eric II of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1528–1584)Maurice (1521–1553), Elector of Saxonymarried in 1541 princess Agnes of Hesse (1527–1555)Severinus (1522–1533)
Augustus (1526–1586), Elector of Saxonymarried in 1548 princess Anne of Denmark and Norway (1532–1585)Catherine sympathized early with Martin Luther's teachings, while her husband suppressed the Reformation until 1536 for fear of his brother, the reigning Duke George the Bearded.  Later, the Freiberg area became Lutheran.
When duke George tried bear down on Catherine, she told the envoy: You could do me a big favor by leaving Freiberg right now.  In 1539, after the death of Duke George, the couple moved to Dresden and brought the Reformation there.  Duke Henry died on 18 August 1541; Catherine outlived him by 20 years.  She spent her days in Wolkenstein castle.  In 1560, she published a book on etiquette for ladies, which is culturally and historically very interesting.
