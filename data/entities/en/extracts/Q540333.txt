Dorking  is a market town in Surrey, south east England, 21 miles (34 km) south of London. The main axis of the town runs east-west along the northern face of an outcrop of Lower Greensand and parallel to the course of the Pipp Brook. The town is between Ranmore Common on the North Downs  and Leith Hill in the Greensand Ridge.
In the Georgian and Victorian periods six prominent sites in the former parish or on its boundaries became grand country estates: Leith Hill Place, Denbies (today a vineyard/hotel), Norbury Park, Polesden Lacey, Wotton House and Deepdene; five of which along with nearby Box Hill's promontory and chalk grassland slopes belong to the National Trust.  Dorking is a commuter and retirement settlement with three railway stations and a few large offices of multinational companies.  Similarly, Malden in 1911, noted the place was "almost entirely residential and agricultural, with some lime works on the chalk, though not so extensive as those in neighbouring parishes, a little brick-making, water-mills (corn) at Pixham Mill, and timber and saw-mills". Fine sand often in veins of pink colour, used for mortar and in glassmaking was dug, particularly in the 19th century â€” the Dorking Caves were accordingly excavated under southern parts of the town centre itself.
Dorking chickens with short five-toed legs are a major local breed.  The town has a local government headquarters and hosts repeating loops of the FIA-ranked London-Surrey cycle classic elite category event every year.
