Farkasréti Cemetery or Farkasrét Cemetery (Hungarian: Farkasréti temető) is one of the most famous cemeteries in Budapest. It opened in 1894 and is noted for its extensive views of the city (several people wanted it more to be a resort area than a cemetery).
It comprises tombs of numerous Hungarian notables and it is the most preferred burial place among actors, actresses and other artists (opera singers, musicians, painters, sculptors, architects, writers, poets). The cemetery is also home to the tombs of several scientists, academicians and athletes.
Graves are often decorated with noteworthy sculptures. It was provided with parks in the 1950s, when it took on its present appearance and extent. The mortuary hall and the new chapel were built in the 1980s to the plans of Imre Makovecz.
In the Communist era, funerals were restricted in Kerepesi Cemetery, so it became the main cemetery for those who couldn't get one.
It is located in Buda (the Western part of Budapest), approximately 3 km away from the downtown.
The oldest grave that is still located in its original place is that of the mechanical engineer Ferenc Cathry Szaléz, the designer of the Rack railway in Budapest and the original Mária Valéria bridge in Esztergom.
