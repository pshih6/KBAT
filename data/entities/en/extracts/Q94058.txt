Eugen von Philippovich (1858-1917) was an Austrian economist. He studied under Karl Menger, and taught at the University of Freiberg before moving to be professor of economics at the University of Vienna in 1893. His textbook Grundriss der politischen Oekonomie was "the most successful German-language textbook on economics" of its time: the first volume went through 19 editions, selling over 63,000 copies.
