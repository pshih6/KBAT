Suspense is a state of mental uncertainty, anxiety, of being undecided, or of being doubtful.  In a dramatic work, suspense is the anticipation of the outcome of a plot or of the solution to an uncertainty, puzzle, or mystery, particularly as it affects a character for whom one has sympathy.  However, suspense is not exclusive to fiction.
