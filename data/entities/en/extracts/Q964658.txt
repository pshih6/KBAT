Outlaw country is a subgenre of American country music, most popular during the 1970s and early 1980s, sometimes referred to as the outlaw movement or simply outlaw music. The music has its roots in earlier subgenres like honky tonk and rockabilly and is characterized by a blend of rock and folk rhythms, country instrumentation and introspective lyrics. The movement began as a reaction to the slick production and popular structures of the Nashville sound developed by record producers like Chet Atkins.Early "outlaws" include Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, Shel Silverstein, Chris Gantry, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Guy Clark, Jessi Colter, Tompall Glaser, David Allan Coe, Sammi Smith, and Tanya Tucker. Other associated artists include Hank Williams Jr., Charlie Daniels, B. W. Stevenson, the Eli Radish Band, Leon Russell, Townes Van Zandt, Billy Joe Shaver, Steve Earle, Joe Ely, Johnny Paycheck, Ed Bruce and Gary Stewart.
