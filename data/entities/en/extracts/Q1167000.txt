Daryl Palumbo (born February 10, 1979) is an American musician, originally from Bellmore, New York. He is the frontman of the bands Glassjaw, Head Automatica and Color Film. As a youth he was a member of the Long Island straight edge band XbustedX. In 1993 he met guitarist Justin Beck, who would become his good friend. Together they formed Glassjaw.
Palumbo has Crohn's disease, which has acted as inspiration for much of his musical output, most notably in the lyrical content of Glassjaw's major label debut Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence. His affliction has affected his bands' ability to tour, including the cancellation of a tour with The Used in 2005.
