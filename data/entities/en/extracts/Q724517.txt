Tomi Petteri Putaansuu (best known by his stage name, Mr Lordi, or Mr L, born 15 February 1974) is a Finnish musician, businessman, special effect make-up artist, songwriter, actor, painter, comics artist and graphic designer.
Mr Lordi is best known as the lead vocalist in the heavy metal/hard rock band Lordi. In the band he is responsible for songwriting and creating all the masks, costumes, graphics and stage props.
Mr Lordi has written songs and painted cover artworks for many bands and artists like Rotten Sound, Jope Ruonansuu, Domination Black, Grandevils and Agnes Pihlava. He has also had a few art exhibitions in Finland.
All publicity photographs of Mr Lordi have his face concealed with his mask and stage makeup. However, many tabloids have published fake photos of his unmasked face. A real published photograph of his unmasked face was taken in the early 1990s, as the chairman of Kiss Army Finland.
