As of 2017, CEU had 1,448 students from 117 countries and 723 faculty members from more than 40 countries.CEU has 13 academic departments, 17 research centers, and two schools, including the School of Public Policy and the Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations. The CEU Business School merged with the economics department in August 2017 to form the Department of Economics and Business.On 3 December 2018, the university announced it would cease operations in Hungary and relocate to Vienna, according to the university, after the Hungarian government's refusal to sign an agreement allowing it to continue operations in Hungary.
