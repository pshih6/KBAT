Zoran Simjanović (pronounced [zǒran simjǎːnoʋitɕ]; born 11 May 1946) is a Serbian composer. Since 1961 he founded and played in some of the most popular rock bands in Yugoslavia and abroad (Siluete, Elipse). He also wrote songs for his friends who won prizes in festivals, although he finally never had a great interest for pop music in general.
Since 1975, he has composed scores for the cinema, television and theatre, in Yugoslavia and abroad. He wrote the music for no less than 55 films, including a large amount for television. He is currently teacher at the Faculty of Scenic Arts and the Faculty of Art of Music in Belgrade.
