Julius Anton Glaser (born Joshua Glaser 19 March 1831 â€“ 26 December 1885) was an Austrian jurist and classical-liberal politician. Along with Joseph Unger he is considered to be one of the founders of modern Austrian jurisprudence.
He joined the Auersperg cabinet as Minister of Justice in 1871. Upon resigning this office in 1879, he was appointed attorney-general at the Vienna Court of Cassation, a position he held until his death. Glaser was a prominent representative of Austrian High Liberalism, with a particular emphasis on the cultural and political preeminence of the German part of the Empire. He was responsible for several liberal penal law reforms, most notably the 1873 Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure, and he advocated the abolition of the death penalty.
