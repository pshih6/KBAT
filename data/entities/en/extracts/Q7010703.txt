New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, or NOCCA, is the regional, pre-professional arts training center for high school students in Louisiana. NOCCA opened in 1973 as a professional arts training center for secondary school-age children. Located in New Orleans, it provides intensive instruction in culinary arts, creative writing, dance, media arts, music (classical, jazz, vocal), theatre arts (drama, musical theatre, theatre design), and visual arts while demanding simultaneous academic excellence.
NOCCA was founded by a group of artists, educators, business leaders, and community activists. Tuition is free to all Louisiana students who meet audition requirements. Students from over 100 public, private, parochial and home schools attend in the afternoon or late-day as well as Academic Studio students who attend NOCCA for the full day. Academic Studio students, accepted by a successful arts audition, learn through problem-solving and project-based learning. Students graduate from NOCCA receiving a TOPS University Diploma. Every year, 95-98% of NOCCA graduates go on to college and conservatory programs across the country. Approximately 80% of NOCCA students receive scholarships to pursue such higher education as well.
Graduates include Terence Blanchard, Harry Connick Jr., Branford Marsalis, Wynton Marsalis, Jeanne-Michele Charbonnet, Mary Catherine Garrison, Anthony Mackie, Wendell Pierce, Gary Solomon Jr., Jon Batiste, Joshua Stewart, Gustave Blache III, Nicole Cooley, Erica Wiltz, Nicholas Payton, Trombone Shorty, Poppy Tooker, Terrance Osborne, Wanda Boudreaux and DJ Hollygrove of The Chopstars.
In 2000, NOCCA moved to a campus in the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood. Before that, NOCCA was housed for many years in an old elementary school building on Perrier Street in Uptown New Orleans.
