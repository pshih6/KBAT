Johann Georg Albinus (6 March 1624 â€“ 25 May 1679) was a German Protestant pastor and hymnwriter. He studied at the University of Leipzig and served as a rector at the Naumburg Cathedral School and the pastor of St. Othmar's Church, both in Naumburg. His hymns have been adapted by later composers, particularly by Johann Sebastian Bach in BWV 27 and BWV 158.
