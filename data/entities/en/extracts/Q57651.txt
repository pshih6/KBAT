Maria Anna of Neuburg (Spanish: Mariana; 28 October 1667 â€“ 16 July 1740), was Queen of Spain from 1689 to 1700 as the second wife of Charles II, last Habsburg King of Spain.
Her marriage was dominated by the political struggle between French and Austrian factions over the Spanish throne, which resulted in the 1701 to 1714 War of the Spanish Succession. When Charles died in 1700, he was succeeded by the French candidate, Philip V and Maria Anna was exiled. She lived largely forgotten until her death in 1740.
