Vasily Vasilievich Andreyev (Russian: Василий Васильевич Андреев; 15 January [O.S. 3 January] 1861 – 1918) was a Russian musician responsible for the modern development of the balalaika and several other traditional Russian folk music instruments, and is considered the father of the academic folk instrument movement in Eastern Europe. His accomplishments included:

developing in the 1880s a standardized balalaika made with the assistance of violin maker V. Ivanov.
reviving the domra, a three-stringed long-necked melody instrument with a melon-shaped body, which he developed in prima, alto, tenor, and bass sizes.
reviving the gusli, an autoharp chorded with piano-type keys.
arranging many traditional Russian folk songs and melodies for the orchestra
composing many tunes of his own.
