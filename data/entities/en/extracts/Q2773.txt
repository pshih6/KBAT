Braunschweig (German pronunciation: [ˈbʁaʊnʃvaɪk] (listen); Low German: Brunswiek [ˈbrɔˑnsviːk]), also called Brunswick () in English, is a city in Lower Saxony, Germany, north of the Harz mountains at the farthest navigable point of the Oker River which connects it to the North Sea via the Aller and Weser Rivers. In 2016, it had a population of 250,704.
A powerful and influential centre of commerce in medieval Germany, Braunschweig was a member of the Hanseatic League from the 13th until the 17th century. It was the capital city of three successive states: the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1269–1432, 1754–1807, and 1813–1814), the Duchy of Brunswick (1814–1918), and the Free State of Brunswick (1918–1946).
Today, Braunschweig is the second-largest city in Lower Saxony and a major centre of scientific research and development.
