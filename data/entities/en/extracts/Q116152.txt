Heinrich Hössli (6 August 1784 in Glarus – 24 December 1864 in Winterthur), sometimes written as Hößli,  was a Swiss hatter and author. His book Eros Die Männerliebe der Griechen (2 vols., 1836, 1838) surveyed references to same-sex love in ancient Greek literature and more recent research, and was one of the first works in the 19th century that defended love between men.
