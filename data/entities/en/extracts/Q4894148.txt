Bernhard Baron (5 December 1850 – 1 August 1929) was a tobacco manufacturer and philanthropist. He was born at Brest-Litovsk (modern Belarus), in poor circumstances, to Jewish parents, and brought up among the Don Cossacks at Rostov. His father took him to the United States when young; and there, after working at a tobacco factory, he began making the newly popularised cigarettes by hand. He invented a cigarette-making machine which he brought back to England and sold for £160,000. With this money he bought the tobacco business of Mme. Carrera  in 1903.
In the later years of his life, he engaged in charity on a grand scale, contributing over £750,000 to hospitals, as well as endowing a trust for the benefit of hospital and asylum patients. He died at Brighton in 1920, and his estate was valued at £5 million. His son Louis Baron was created a Baronet in 1930.
Amongst the projects supported by the Trust was a cradle-to-grave school in the East End of London, originally established as the St George's Jewish Settlement and run by Basil Henriques and Rose Henriques. With a capacity of over 1,000 pupils it provided everything from kindergarten to adult-literacy. The school, at 71 Henriques Street, still stands and has been converted to flats.
