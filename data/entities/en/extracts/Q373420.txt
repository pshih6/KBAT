Bruna Surfistinha (Portuguese for "Little Surfer Bruna") is the pen name of Raquel Pacheco (born 28 October 1984), a Brazilian former sex worker who attracted the attention of Brazilian media by publishing, in a blog, her sexual experiences with clients. Bruna explained in television programs that she was a normal girl, who had been adopted by a high/middle-class family but that at around the age of 17 she left her home and her family because of the traditional family oriented views of her father and to start to live on her own. Bruna appeared in various television programs in Brazil and several periodicals and magazines. Her blog attracted more than 50,000 readers per day. She appeared in some pornographic films in Brazil. In 2005, she released a book entitled O Doce Veneno do Escorpi√£o (The Scorpion's Sweet Venom). In just over a month it sold over 30,000 copies in its third edition, and became the best selling book in Brazil. The book was translated into English and published by Bloomsbury Publishing in 2006. Bruna's book also inspired the 2011 Brazilian film Confessions of a Brazilian Call Girl, starring Deborah Secco in the main role, and the 2016 TV series Me Chama de Bruna, starring Maria Bopp in the main role. In 2011, Bruna also appeared in a Brazilian reality show called A Fazenda (local version of The Farm) finishing as the second runner-up (third place). Confessions of a Brazilian Call Girl grossed $12,356,515 in Brazil, first national film after international films in the Brazil 2011 Box Office, thanks to Bruna's popularity with the Brazilian public.
