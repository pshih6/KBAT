Sunspot (Roberto da Costa) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is most commonly associated with X-Men-related groups the New Mutants and X-Force.
A mutant from Brazil, Sunspot possesses the ability to absorb and channel solar power. He is idealistic and impulsive, but is considered a close friend of many of his teammates. He was an important member of the X-Men's 1980s-era junior team and its reincarnation X-Force. He later retired his career as Sunspot and garnered a massive fortune, allowing him to buy out the organization Advanced Idea Mechanics, rebranding it Avengers Idea Mechanics, which he operates under the codename Citizen V.
In film, actor Adan Canto portrayed the character in X-Men: Days of Future Past. Henry Zaga will portray a younger version in The New Mutants.
