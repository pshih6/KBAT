Lambert of Ardres (c. 1160 – after 1203) was a French twelfth century chronicler.
He was a parish priest at Ardres, and related to the Counts of Guînes. He wrote for that family a Historia comitum Ghisnensium, between 1194 and 1198. It is mixture of history and folklore. It also contains a contemporary description of a donjon.
