The Christian Democratic Union of Germany (German: Christlich-Demokratische Union Deutschlands, CDU) was an East German political party founded in 1945.  It was part of the National Front with the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and a bloc party until 1989.
It contested the free elections in 1990 as an arm of the West German Christian Democratic Union, into which it merged after German reunification later that same year.
