Mark Sinclair (born July 18, 1967), known professionally as Vin Diesel, is an American actor and producer. He rose to international fame with his role as Dominic Toretto in The Fast and the Furious franchise.
Diesel began his career in 1990, but initially struggled to gain roles until he created and starred in the short film Multi-Facial (1995), which attracted the attention of Steven Spielberg, who was developing the film Saving Private Ryan at the time. Spielberg re-wrote elements of the film to allow Diesel to appear in it, which helped kickstart Diesel's acting career. He subsequently voiced the titular character in The Iron Giant (1999), while gaining a reputation as an action star after headlining The Fast and the Furious, the XXX series, and The Chronicles of Riddick.
Later in his career, Diesel became known for lending his voice to the character of Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and voicing a cameo of the same character in Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018). He also founded the production company One Race Films. Away from action films, Diesel has enjoyed commercial success in a number of other genres, such as in the comedy film The Pacifier (2005), while his performance in Find Me Guilty (2006) was praised.
Diesel portrayed the comic book character Bloodshot in its 2020 film adaptation, and is slated to appear in the Avatar sequels.
