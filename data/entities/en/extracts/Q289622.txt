The Proclaimers are a Scottish rock duo formed in 1983 by twin brothers Craig and Charlie Reid, who were born 5 March 1962. They came to attention with their 1987 single "Letter from America", which reached No. 3 in the United Kingdom, and the 1988 single "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)", which topped charts in Australia, Iceland and New Zealand. The Proclaimers have sold over 5 million albums worldwide.First active from 1983 as an acoustic duo, the Proclaimers moved toward band-oriented rock in later works. The Proclaimers' style draws from a diversity of influences, including country, folk, and the punk rock of the Clash. Their playing range has included roots rock, alternative rock and folk rock, and their music is typified by thick Scottish accents in their vocals.The Proclaimers consistently tour the world, and have released 11 studio albums since 1987, the most recent being 2018's Angry Cyclist, as well as three compilation albums and a DVD.
