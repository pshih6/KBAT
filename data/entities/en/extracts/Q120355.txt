Julius Michael Johannes Maggi (9 October 1846 â€“  19 October 1912) was a Swiss entrepreneur, inventor of precooked soups and Maggi sauce. He was the youngest of five children of Michael Maggi, an immigrant from Italy, and his Swiss wife Sophie. He died in 1912 after a stroke. He married twice and had four daughters and two sons. He may also have collaborated with Auguste Escoffier in the late 19th century and thus commercialized the stock cube (see the Maggi company).
