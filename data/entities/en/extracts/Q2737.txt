Louis Germain David de Funès de Galarza (French pronunciation: ​[lwi ʒɛʁmɛ̃ david də fynɛs də ɡalaʁza]; 31 July 1914 – 27 January 1983) was a French actor and comedian. According to several polls conducted since 1968, he is France's favourite actor – having played over 130 roles in film and over 100 on stage. His acting style is remembered for its high-energy performance and his wide range of facial expressions and tics. A considerable part of his best-known acting was directed by Jean Girault.
He often still is a household name in many countries such as Israel, Greece, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Belgium, Serbia, Poland, Bulgaria, Germany, Spain, Turkey, Albania, Romania, Croatia, former countries of the Soviet Union, as well as Iran. Yet he remains almost unknown in the English-speaking world. He was exposed to a wider audience only once in the United States, in 1974, with the release of The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob, which was nominated for a Golden Globe Award.
