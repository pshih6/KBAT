The Progressive Party (Spanish: Partido Progresista) was one of the two Spanish political parties that contended for power during the reign of Isabel II (reigned 1833â€“1868). They were to the left of the opposing Moderate Party (Spanish: Partido Moderado), but also characterized themselves as liberal. Like the Moderates, they supported Isabel against the claims of the Carlists.
