The Saint in Palm Springs is a crime melodrama released by RKO Pictures in early 1941. The film continued the screen adventures of the Robin Hood-inspired anti-hero, Simon Templar, alias "The Saint", created by Leslie Charteris.
This sequel was based upon a story by Charteris; however, many changes to his concept were made. Charteris later novelised his version of the film story as the novella "Palm Springs", contained within the collection The Saint Goes West. This was the sixth of eight in RKO's film series about The Saint.
The central cast was identical to the previous entry, The Saint Takes Over. George Sanders returned  as Templar (his final performance in the role), with Jonathan Hale making his own final appearance as Inspector Farnack. (The character would next be seen in The Saint in Manhattan, a 1980s television pilot.) Wendy Barrie makes her third and final appearance, once again playing a different character, as does Paul Guilfoyle, reprising the role of Clarence "Pearly" Gates from the previous film.
The storyline involves The Saint pursuing rare stamps at a Palm Springs, California hotel.
