Harem (ハーレムもの, hāremumono, "harem works") is a subgenre of Japanese light novels, manga, anime, and video games focused on polygynous/polyandrous relationships, where a protagonist is surrounded by three or more love interests or sexual partners. A male-heterosexual or yuri harem series is informally referred to as a female harem or seraglios, while a female-heterosexual or yaoi harem series is informally referred to as a male harem, reverse harem, or gyaku hāremu (逆ハーレム).
