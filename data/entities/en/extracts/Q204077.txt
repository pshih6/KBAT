Cao Cao (pronunciation ; [tsʰǎu tsʰáu]; Chinese: 曹操; c. 155 – 15 March 220), courtesy name Mengde, was a Chinese warlord and poet. He was the penultimate Chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty who rose to great power in the final years of the dynasty. As one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms period, he laid the foundations for what was to become the state of Cao Wei and ultimately the Jin dynasty, and was posthumously honoured as "Emperor Wu of Wei" although he never was an emperor during his life time. He is often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant in subsequent literature; however, he has also been praised as a brilliant ruler and military genius with unrivalled charisma who treated his subordinates like his family. He is still a very disputed historical figure but there is no question that he was the most successful warlord of his time.
During the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Cao was able to secure the most of Northern China that was the most populated and developed part of China. Cao Cao was also very successful to restore public order and rebuild economy as the Han chancellor but his handling of the Han Emperor Xian was heavily criticised as Cao Cao's power went way beyond the emperor's. Opposition directly gathered around warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan, whom Cao Cao was unable to quell.
Cao Cao was also skilled in poetry, calligraphy and martial arts and wrote many war journals including remarks added to famour the Art of War written by Sun Tzu.
