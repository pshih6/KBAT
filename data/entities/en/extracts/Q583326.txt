Donal MacIntyre (born 25 January 1966) is an Irish investigative journalist, specialising in investigations, undercover operations and television expos√©s.
The risks of repeatedly going undercover have meant that MacIntyre has increasingly turned to presenting on films where his colleagues have undertaken the undercover work. He has also branched out into more traditional presenting roles, on weather phenomena and wildlife documentaries on the BBC and Channel 5. In 2007 he directed A Very British Gangster, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. From April 2010, MacIntyre presented ITV's local news show London Tonight, departing after only a few months after taking up the post. MacIntyre is also famously known for his solo episode investigation entitled "Cheap As Chimps".
In 2009, MacIntyre took part in the fourth series of Dancing on Ice, where he was runner-up to Ray Quinn. In 2014, he participated in the first series of The Jump where he was runner-up to Joe McElderry.
MacIntyre currently fronts the CBS Reality documentary series Donal MacIntyre: Unsolved, which looks at unsolved cases such as abductions and murders, that MacIntyre and his team try to shed new light upon.
