Seventeen Moments of Spring (Russian: Семнадцать мгновений весны, romanized: Semnadtsat' mgnoveniy vesny) is a 1973 Soviet twelve-part television series, directed by Tatyana Lioznova and based on the novel of the same title by Yulian Semyonov.
The series portrays the exploits of Maxim Isaev, a Soviet spy operating in Nazi Germany under the name Max Otto von Stierlitz, portrayed by Vyacheslav Tikhonov. Stierlitz is planted in 1927, well before the Nazi takeover of pre-war Germany. He then enlists in the NSDAP and rises through the ranks, becoming an important Nazi foreign intelligence officer. He recruits several agents from among dissident German intellectuals and persecuted clergy, and operates through the agent network. Stierlitz discovers, and later schemes to disrupt, the secret negotiations between Karl Wolff and Allen Dulles taking place in Switzerland, aimed at forging a separate peace between Germany and the western Allies. Meanwhile, the Gestapo under Heinrich Müller searches for the unidentified Soviet resident spy and his ring. In order to avoid capture Stierlitz cunningly manoeuvres among powerful Nazis, and pulls the strings of his network.
The series is considered the most successful Soviet espionage thriller ever made, and is one of the most popular television series in Soviet history. Two songs from the series, "Moments" and "The Song on the Far-away Homeland", became very popular.
