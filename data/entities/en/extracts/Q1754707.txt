The Liberal Unionist Party was a British political party that was formed in 1886 by a faction that broke away from the Liberal Party. Led by Lord Hartington (later the Duke of Devonshire) and Joseph Chamberlain, the party formed a political alliance with the Conservative Party in opposition to Irish Home Rule. The two parties formed the ten-year-long coalition Unionist Government 1895â€“1905 but kept separate political funds and their own party organisations until a complete merger between the  Liberal  Unionist  and the  Conservative parties was agreed to  in May 1912.
