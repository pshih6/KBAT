Fahreta Živojinović (née Jahić, Serbo-Croatian Cyrillic: Фахрета Живојиновић Јахић; born 20 October 1960), known by her stage name Lepa Brena (Serbo-Croatian Cyrillic: Лепа Брена), is a pop-folk singer, actress, and talent manager. She is the best-selling female recording artist from the former Yugoslavia.
Lepa Brena grew up in Brčko, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and has lived in Belgrade, Serbia since 1980, where she started her career. Lepa Brena is considered to be a symbol of the former Yugoslavia, due to the fact that she was one of the last popular acts to emerge before the break up of Yugoslavia. She has described herself as being Yugo-nostalgic. Along with her husband, Slobodan Živojinović and friend, Saša Popović, Brena co-founded and co-owns Grand Production, the biggest record label and production company in the Balkans. In 2019, they decided to sell the Grand Production for €30 million.
