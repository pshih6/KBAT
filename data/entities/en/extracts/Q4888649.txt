Benjamin Franklin Jones, Sr. (August 8, 1824 â€“ May 19, 1903) was a pioneer of the iron and steel industry in Pittsburgh.  Originally involved in the river barge industry, he purchased a share in American Iron Works in 1851, along with Bernard Lauth.   He later joined with James H. Laughlin to form Jones and Laughlin Steel Company, a steel mill heavily dependent on river transportation. The B.F. Jones Memorial Library in Aliquippa Pennsylvania, the site of J&L Steel's Aliquippa Works, was built in his honor with funds donated by his daughter.
