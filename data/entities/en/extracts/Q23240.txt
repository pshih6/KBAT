Essex () is a county in the southeast of England, northeast of London. One of the home counties, it borders Suffolk and Cambridgeshire to the north, Hertfordshire to the west, Kent across the estuary of the River Thames to the south, and London to the southwest. The county town is Chelmsford, the only city in the county. For government statistical purposes Essex is placed in the East of England region.
There are three definitions of the extent of Essex, the widest being the Ancient County, the more usual being the smaller Ceremonial County and smallest being the administrative county â€“ the area administered by the County Council and which excludes the two unitary authorities of Thurrock and Southend-on-Sea.
The Ceremonial County occupies the eastern part of what was, during the Early Middle Ages, the Kingdom of Essex. As well as rural areas, the county also includes London Stansted Airport, the new towns of Basildon and Harlow, Lakeside Shopping Centre, the port of Tilbury and the borough of Southend-on-Sea.
