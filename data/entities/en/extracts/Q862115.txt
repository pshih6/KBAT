William Howard "Bill" Frindall,  (3 March 1939 â€“ 29 January 2009) was an English cricket scorer and statistician. He was familiar to cricket followers as a member of the Test Match Special commentary team on BBC radio. Nicknamed the Bearded Wonder (shortened to Bearders) by Brian Johnston for his ability to research the most obscure cricketing facts in moments, while continuing to keep perfect scorecards and because he had a beard. Angus Fraser described Frindall as "the doyen of cricket scorers" in his obituary in The Independent.
