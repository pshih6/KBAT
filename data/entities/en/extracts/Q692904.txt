Arne Treholt (born 13 December 1942) is a Norwegian former KGB agent who was convicted of treason and espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union against Norway during the Cold War. Before his arrest in 1984 he was successively a journalist, a junior Norwegian Labour Party politician and a medium-level official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Norway. Treholt's espionage is generally seen as the most serious spy case in the modern history of Norway. He was arrested in 1984 and sentenced to 20 years in prison the following year, of which he served nine in a maximum security prison. After his release from prison in 1992, Treholt moved to Russia where he started a company together with a former KGB general. Following his arrest Treholt was described as "the greatest traitor to Norway since Quisling." After his release from prison Treholt has occasionally been active in public debate, and he has been accused by Norwegian media of promoting Russian propaganda "as taken straight from the propaganda channel Russia Today or a handbook for the web brigades or Russian agents of influence in troll factories."
