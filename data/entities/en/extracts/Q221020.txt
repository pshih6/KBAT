The Nutcracker in 3D (released on DVD as The Nutcracker: The Untold Story) is a 2010 British-Hungarian 3D Christmas musical fantasy film adapted from the ballet The Nutcracker. Co-written, directed, and co-produced by Andrei Konchalovsky, the film stars Elle Fanning, Nathan Lane, and John Turturro with Charles Rowe and Shirley Henderson as the Nutcracker. It was universally panned by critics upon its release, and was criticized for its story, deviations from the ballet, twisted visuals, and the rats' similarities to Nazis. It was a box office bomb, grossing $20 million against a $90 million budget.
