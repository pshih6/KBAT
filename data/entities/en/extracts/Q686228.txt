The National Liberal Party (Romanian: Partidul Na»õional Liberal, PNL) is a conservative-liberal and liberal conservative political party in Romania. Refounded in 1990, it claims the legacy of the major political party of the same name, active between 1875 and the late 1940s in the Kingdom of Romania. Based on this legacy, it often presents itself as the first formally constituted political party in the country and the oldest party from the family of European liberal parties.Until 2014, the PNL was a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). The party statutes adopted in June 2014 dropped any reference to international affiliation, consequently most of its MEPs joined the European People's Party group (EPP) in the European Parliament.
On 12 September 2014, it was admitted as a full member of the European People's Party, and subsequently merged with the Democratic Liberal Party. The party was also a member of the Liberal International before switching to Centrist Democrat International. Currently, it is the second-largest party in the Romanian Parliament, with 82 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 31 in the Senate, behind the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD).
