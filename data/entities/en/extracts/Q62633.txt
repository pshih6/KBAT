The Grand Duchy of Finland (Finnish: Suomen suuriruhtinaskunta, Swedish: Storfurstendömet Finland, Russian: Великое княжество Финляндское, Velikoye knyazhestvo Finlyandskoye; literally meaning "Grand Principality of Finland"), or, more accurately, the Grand Principality of Finland, was the predecessor state of modern Finland. It existed between 1809 and 1917 as an autonomous part of the Russian Empire.
Originating in the 16th century as a titular grand principality (often translated into English as a grand duchy) held by the King of Sweden, it became autonomous after the Russian annexation in the Finnish War. The Grand Prince of Finland, usually rendered in English as the Grand Duke of Finland, was the Romanov Emperor of Russia, who was represented by the Governor-General. Due to the governmental structure of the Russian Empire and Finnish initiative, the grand duchy's autonomy expanded until the end of the 19th century. The Senate of Finland was founded in 1809, which became the most important governmental organ and the precursor to the modern Government of Finland, Supreme Court of Finland and the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland.The economic, social and political changes in the Grand Principality of Finland were closely connected with those in the rest of the Russian Empire and the rest of Europe. The economy grew slowly during the first half of the 19th century. The reign of Alexander II after 1855 saw significant cultural, social and intellectual progress and an industrializing economy. Tensions increased after the Russification policies were enacted in 1889, which saw the introduction of limited autonomy and the reduction of Finnish cultural expression. The unrest in Russia and Finland during the First World War and the subsequent collapse of the Russian Empire resulted in the Finnish Declaration of Independence and the end of the Grand Principality.
