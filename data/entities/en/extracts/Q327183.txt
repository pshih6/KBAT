Vinton Hayworth (June 4, 1906 â€“ May 21, 1970),  also known as Jack Arnold and Vincent Haworth, was an American actor, playwright and screenwriter who began in weaselly and milquetoast roles and aged into dignified character parts. He appeared in over 90 films during his career, as well as on numerous television shows. He is most likely best known for his final role, that of General Winfield Schaeffer in the fourth and fifth seasons of the sitcom I Dream of Jeannie. He is the uncle of Rita Hayworth, as well as being the uncle (by marriage) of Ginger Rogers.
