Lygia Bojunga (born 26 August 1932, in Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul) is a Brazilian writer of children's books under the name Lygia Bojunga Nunes. She is one of three people to win the two major international awards: for "lasting contribution to children's literature", she received the Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1982. For her career contribution to "children's and young adult literature in the broadest sense" she won the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award in 2004.A major element of her books is the usage of the child's point of view.Lygia Bojunga is part of the tradition of magical realism and fantasy-filled storytelling of South America. In her word-of-mouth style narratives, characterised by a strongly dramatic presence, anything can happen. She fuses playfulness, poetic beauty and absurd humour with social critique, a love of freedom and a strong empathy with the vulnerable child. Fantasy often functions as a way of dealing with distressing personal experiences, or as an escape from harsh reality. Bojunga enables the reader to enter directly into the dreams of her principal characters and to share in their experiences.
