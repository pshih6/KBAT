Nigel Marven (born 27 November 1960) is a British wildlife TV presenter, television producer, author and birdwatcher. He is known for his unorthodox, spontaneous, and daring style of presenting wildlife documentaries as well as for including factual knowledge in the proceedings. This has led some people to compare him to Steve Irwin. Nigel ran the 2008 London marathon in 4 hours 4 minutes to try to raise Â£20,000 for the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society UK.
