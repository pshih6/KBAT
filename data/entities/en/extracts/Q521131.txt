Frédéric Martel (born 28 October 1967) is a French writer, researcher and journalist. His most famous pieces of work are The Pink and the Black, Homosexuals in France since 1968 (1996 - trans. into English at Stanford University Press), Mainstream (on global culture - 2010), "Smart" (on the "internets" - 2014) and De la culture en Amérique, a book about cultural policies and industries in the United States, which was featured on the cover of the New York Times art section in 2006. NYT's journalist Alan Riding wrote : "In Culture in America, a 622-page tome weighty with information, Martel challenges the conventional view in France that (French) culture financed and organized by the government is entirely good and that (American) culture shaped by market forces is necessarily bad".
