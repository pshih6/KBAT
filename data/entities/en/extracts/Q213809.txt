Hermann Rauschning (7 August 1887 – February 8, 1982) was a German conservative reactionary who briefly joined the Nazi movement before breaking with it. He was the President of the Free City of Danzig from 1933-1934, during which he led the Senate of the Free City of Danzig. In 1934, he renounced Nazi Party membership and in 1936 emigrated from Germany. He eventually settled in the United States and began openly denouncing Nazism. Rauschning is chiefly known for his book Gespräche mit Hitler (Conversations with Hitler, American title: Voice of Destruction, British title: Hitler Speaks) in which he claimed to have had many meetings and conversations with Adolf Hitler.
