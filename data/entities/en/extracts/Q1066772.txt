Charley Frank Pride (born March 18, 1934) is an American singer, musician, guitarist, business owner, and former professional baseball player. His greatest musical success came in the early to mid-1970s, when he became the best-selling performer for RCA Records since Elvis Presley. During the peak years of his recording career (1966â€“87), he garnered 52 top-10 hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, 30 of which made it to number one.
Pride is one of the few African-Americans (along with DeFord Bailey and Darius Rucker) to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2000.
