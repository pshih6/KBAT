Ivo Sanader (born 8 June 1953) is a Croatian politician who was the 8th Prime Minister of Croatia from 2003 to 2009. He is to date the longest-serving prime minister since independence, holding the office for over five and a half years before resigning in July 2009. He is the only Croatian prime minister to serve more than one term, winning general elections in 2003, and 2007. Along with Ivica Račan, he is one of only two prime ministers to have been at the head of more than one government cabinet, chairing his first cabinet from December 2003 until January 2008, and his second cabinet from January 2008 until his resignation in July 2009.
Sanader obtained his education in comparative literature in Austria, where he also worked as a journalist, in marketing, publishing, and as an entrepreneur. In the 1990s, he was briefly the intendant of the Croatian National Theatre in Split before becoming Minister for Science and Technology as a member of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) in the Cabinet of Hrvoje Šarinić in 1992. In 1993, he moved into diplomacy and served two terms as Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Following the death of Franjo Tuđman, Sanader was elected leader of the HDZ party in 2000, and again in 2002, and led the party to victory in the 2003, and 2007 elections, becoming Croatia's prime minister. In June 2009, Sanader abruptly resigned his post, leaving scarce explanation for his actions and disappearing from public life for a while. In January 2010, Sanader tried to stage a political comeback within the HDZ, but was ejected from party membership.
In December 2010, Croatian authorities indicted him in two high-profile corruption cases. Sanader fled the country but was apprehended in Austria and then extradited to Croatia in July 2011. In November 2012, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison in a first instance verdict, later reduced to ​8 1⁄2 years. However, his sentence was annulled by Croatia's Constitutional Court in 2015. With the exception of numerous Croatian officials who were sentenced to imprisonment during the existence of the socialist Yugoslavia, he is the first Croatian head of government and highest ranking state official to be tried and sentenced to a jail term.
On 22 October 2018, Sanader was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for war profiteering and must return $570,000 in kickbacks from Hypo Bank.
