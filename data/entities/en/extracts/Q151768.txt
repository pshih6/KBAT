The Conservative Democratic Party of Switzerland (German: Bürgerlich-Demokratische Partei Schweiz, BDP; French: Parti bourgeois démocratique suisse, PBD; Italian: Partito Borghese Democratico Svizzero, PBD; Romansh: Partida burgais democratica Svizra PBD , PBD; all translations mean literally Swiss Democratic Bourgeois Party) is a conservative political party in Switzerland. Since the 2019 General election, the BDP has had three members in the National Council and one in the Council of States.
It was founded as a moderate splinter group from the national-conservative Swiss People's Party (SVP), and was founded as a political party on the federal level on 1 November 2008.  It is led by Martin Landolt, and had, until January 2016, one Federal Councillor, Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, whose election in defiance of the SVP incumbent Christoph Blocher led to the creation of the party.  It comprises most of the SVP's old centrist-agrarian wing, which had been overshadowed in recent years by its nationalist-activist wing.
The party's name in German, French, Italian and Romansh comes from "bourgeois", the traditional European term for a centre-right party.
