The Spy in Black (US: U-Boat 29) is a 1939 British film, and the first collaboration between the British filmmakers Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.  They were brought together by Alexander Korda to make the World War I spy thriller by Joseph Storer Clouston into a film. Powell and Pressburger eventually made  over 20 films during the course of their partnership. 
The Spy in Black stars Conrad Veidt, Valerie Hobson, and Sebastian Shaw, and also features Marius Goring and Torin Thatcher as two German submarine officers. And Grant Sutherland, who acted the role of a minister in Powell's The Edge of the World (1937), appears in this film as a Scottish air raid warden.
