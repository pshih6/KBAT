John Ian Robert Russell, 13th Duke of Bedford (24 May 1917 â€“ 25 October 2002), styled Lord Howland until 1940 and Marquess of Tavistock between 1940 and 1953, was a British peer and writer.  With J. Chipperfield he founded Woburn Safari Park and was the first Duke to open to the public the family seat, Woburn Abbey, which houses a large gallery of European paintings.  As with the Duke of Rutland's Belvoir Castle, Woburn is in the county after which the title is named.
