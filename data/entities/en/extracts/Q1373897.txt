Zhou Xinfang (14 January 1895 – 8 March 1975), also known by his stage name Qilin Tong (meaning "Qilin Boy") was a Chinese actor and musician. He was a Peking opera actor who specialized in its "old male" (老生, laosheng) role. He is considered one of the greatest grand masters of Peking Opera of the 20th century, and the best known and leading member of the Shanghai School of Peking Opera.  He was persecuted and died during the Cultural Revolution.
Over 650 Peking Operas performed by Zhou have been identified by the Zhou Xinfang Arts Research Centre in China by 2015, topping all actors in recorded Chinese performing arts history in terms of known number of repertoire titles.
