Baron Roman Fyodorovich von Ungern-Sternberg (born Nikolai Robert Maximilian Freiherr von Ungern-Sternberg; Russian: Рома́н Фёдорович фон У́нгерн-Ште́рнберг, romanized: Román Fëdorovič fon Úngern-Štérnberg; 10 January 1886 [O.S. 29 December 1885] – 15 September 1921), often referred to as Baron Ungern, was an anti-communist general in the Russian Civil War and thereafter an independent warlord who intervened in Mongolia against China. One of the Russian Empire's Baltic German minority, Ungern was an arch-conservative monarchist who aspired to restore the Russian monarchy after the revolutions of 1917 and to revive the Mongol Empire under the rule of the Bogd Khan. His attraction to Vajrayana Buddhism and his eccentric, often violent treatment of enemies and his own men earned him the sobriquet "the Mad Baron" or "the Bloody Baron".
In February 1921, at the head of an "Asiatic Cavalry Division", Ungern expelled Chinese troops from Mongolia and restored the monarchic power of the Bogd Khan. During his five-month occupation of Outer Mongolia, Ungern imposed order on the capital city, Ikh Khüree (now Ulaanbaatar), through fear, intimidation, and brutal violence against his opponents, particularly Bolshevik supporters. In June 1921 he went on to invade east Siberia in support of supposed anti-Bolshevik rebellions and to head off a Red Army-Mongolian partisan invasion; this action led to his defeat and capture two months later. He was taken prisoner by the Red Army and a month later put on trial for counterrevolution in Novonikolaevsk. After a six-hour show trial he was found guilty, and on 15 September 1921 he was executed.
