The Texas State Cemetery (TSC) is a cemetery located on about 22 acres (8.9 ha) just east of downtown Austin, the capital of the U.S. state of Texas. Originally the burial place of Edward Burleson, Texas Revolutionary general and Vice-President of the Republic of Texas, it was expanded into a Confederate cemetery during the Civil War. Later it was expanded again to include the graves and cenotaphs of prominent Texans and their spouses.
It is a popular tourist attraction and colloquially referred to as the "Arlington of Texas" because of the notoriety of those interred and proximity to the seat of government.The cemetery is divided into two sections. The smaller one contains around 900 graves of prominent Texans, while the larger has over 2,000 marked graves of Confederate veterans and widows.  There is room for 7,500 interments; the cemetery is about half full, after including plots chosen by people who are eligible for burial.
