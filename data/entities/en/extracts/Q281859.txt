Vagankovo Cemetery (Vagan'kovskoye Cemetery; Ваганьковское кладбище), established in 1771, is located in the Presnya district of Moscow. It started in the aftermath of the Moscow plague riot of 1771 outside the city proper, so as to prevent the contagion from spreading.
Half a million people are estimated to have  been buried at Vagankovo throughout its history. As of 2010, the existing cemetery contains more than 100,000 graves. The vast necropolis contains the mass graves from the Battle of Borodino, the Battle of Moscow, and the Khodynka Tragedy. It is the burial site for a number of people from the artistic and sports community of Russia and the old Soviet Union. During the Great Purge, alcohol-soused guards would execute weeping prisoners after they had dug their graves in the cemetery.The cemetery is served by several Orthodox churches constructed between 1819 and 1823 in the Muscovite version of the Empire style.
