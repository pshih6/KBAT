Blumentopf ("Flower pot") were a German hip hop band from Freising, near Munich.
In the early days of the band, the members met irregularly and did not have ambitions to become professional musicians.  Each week a new name was chosen.  The band was invited to perform at a festival for their first live show.  The name at the time was Blumentopf and once it appeared on promotional posters for the festival, it stuck.They released their first album in 1997 on Four Music.  They have released five more albums as a group, along with songs released on compilations, and various side projects. Until their dissolution in 2016, they were signed to record label EMI.
The band consisted of five members: rappers Cajus Heinzmann (Cajus, Heinemann, Master P), Bernhard Wunderlich (Holunder, Holundermann, Wunder), Florian Schuster (Flo, Kung Schu, Schu), Roger Manglus (Roger, Specht) and Sebastian Weiss (DJ Sepalot).
In October 2015, they announced that they would dissolve the group and played their last concert in Munich on October 22, 2016, thanking all fans for their continuous support throughout the band's 24-year history.
