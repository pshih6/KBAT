In 1983, Yamaha had manufactured a Guitar specifically for Issei Noro, known as the Yamaha SG-IN (I.N. are his initials.)
In 1987, he joined forces with The Square (now T-Square) guitarist Masahiro Andoh and Hirokuni Korekata. They released 2 live albums and 1 studio album under the name Ottottrio, as a side project.
Also, Issei Noro was a guest musician who performed with the  Sega Sound Team in 1989.It was announced on August 1, 2006 that Casiopea would take a hiatus until further announcement, because of Issei's constant exhaustion from touring and recording.
However, the Closest to a Casiopea Reunion, is that Akira Jimbo (Casiopea's 1980-1989 and 1997-2006 drummer) is a member of Issei Noro's new band from 2008, "Inspirits". Besides having Noro and Jimbo, the band includes bassist Yuji Yajima, Ohgiya Kento on Electric Piano, and Ryo Hayashi on Keyboards. Inspirits is all musical composition and all arrangement by Noro. The group recorded and released 3 albums until Casiopea reunited in 2012, again, under Noro's leadership. Both Inspirits and Casiopea are now active groups.
