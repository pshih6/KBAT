Karl Ludwig von Haller (1 August 1768 – 20 May 1854) was a Swiss jurist.  He was the author of Restauration der Staatswissenschaften (Restoration of the Science of the State, 1816–1834), a book which Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel strongly criticized in Elements of the Philosophy of Right. This work, which was burnt during the Wartburg festival, opposed nationalism and the bureaucracy of extensive government (including democratic governments).
