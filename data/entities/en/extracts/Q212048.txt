Gwyllyn Samuel Newton "Glenn" Ford (May 1, 1916 â€“ August 30, 2006) was a Canadian-American actor whose career lasted more than 50 years. Although he played different types of roles in many genres of movies, Ford was best known for playing ordinary men in unusual circumstances. He was most prominent during Hollywood's Golden Age though he continued as one of the biggest box-office draws of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Some of his most significant roles were in Gilda (1946) and The Big Heat (1953), both films noirs, and the high school angst film Blackboard Jungle (1955). However, it was for comedies or westerns which he received acting laurels, including three Golden Globe Nominations for Best Actor in a Comedy movie, winning for Pocketful of Miracles (1961). He also played a supporting role as Clark Kent's adoptive father in Superman (1978).
Five of his films have been selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically or aesthetically" significant: Gilda (1946), The Big Heat (1953), Blackboard Jungle (1955), 3:10 to Yuma (1957) and Superman (1978).
