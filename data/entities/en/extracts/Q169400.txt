Haruka Shimazaki (島崎 遥香, Shimazaki Haruka, born March 30, 1994) is a Japanese actress, singer, and former member of the Japanese idol group AKB48. Her supposed apathetic attitude toward idol fans led to the popularity of the buzzword "salty treatment" (塩対応, shio taiō) in Japanese media. Since graduating from AKB48 in 2016, Shimazaki has worked as an actress, including roles in Hiyokko, Nisekoi, and Tonde Saitama.
