Jonathan Neale is a British businessman and director of McLaren Group. Neale's role came to general public awareness, when he was personally fined 150,000 Euros for his involvement in the 2007 Formula One espionage controversy, which centred around the theft of 780 pages of confidential Ferrari documents.  Neale remains employed by McLaren in the group operation, alongside Zak Brown.
