Diana Wynne Jones (16 August 1934 â€“ 26 March 2011) was a British novelist, poet, academic, literary critic, and short story writer. She principally wrote fantasy and speculative fiction novels for children and young adults.
Some of her better-known works are the Chrestomanci series, the Dalemark series; the three Moving Castle novels and Dark Lord of Derkholm; and The Tough Guide To Fantasyland.
She has been cited as an inspiration and muse for several fantasy and science fiction authors: including Philip Pullman, Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett, Penelope Lively, Robin McKinley, Megan Whalen Turner, J.K. Rowling and Dina Rabinovitch.
Her work has been nominated for several awards, among them twice as a finalist for the Hugo Award, fourteen times for the Locus Award, seven times for the Mythopoeic Award (which she would win twice out of those seven nominations), twice for a British Fantasy Award (won in 1999), and twice for a World Fantasy Award, which she would also end up winning in 2007.
Jones' work often explores themes of time travel, parallel and/or multiple universes. Her work is usually described as fantasy, though some also incorporate science fiction themes and elements of realism.
