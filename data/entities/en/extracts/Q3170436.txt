Jean Aubert was a French engineer.  In 1961 he used the idea of the German engineer Julius Greve from the last century to describe a pente d'eau, (English: water slope) which was a way of moving boats up the gradient of a canal without locks.  The design consisted of a sloping channel through which a wedge of water on which the boat was floating could be pushed up an incline.  This concept was used in both the Montech water slope and the Fonserannes water slopes.
