The Blob is an independently made 1958 American science fiction-horror film in widescreen color by De Luxe, produced by Jack H. Harris, directed by Irvin Yeaworth, and written by Kay Linaker and Theodore Simonson. The film stars Steve McQueen (in his starring feature film debut, as Steven McQueen) and Aneta Corsaut and co-stars Earl Rowe and Olin Howland. The Blob was distributed by Paramount Pictures as a double feature with I Married a Monster from Outer Space. 
The storyline concerns a growing, corrosive, alien amoeboidal entity that crashes to Earth from outer space inside a meteorite. It devours and dissolves citizens in the small communities of Phoenixville and Downingtown, PA, growing larger, redder, and more aggressive each time it does so, eventually becoming larger than a building.
