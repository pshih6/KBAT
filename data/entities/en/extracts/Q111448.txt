Josef Altstötter (4 January 1892 Bad Griesbach (Rottal), Lower Bavaria – 13 November 1979, Nuremberg) was a high-ranking official in the German Ministry of Justice under the Nazi Regime. Following World War II, he was tried by the Nuremberg Military Tribunal as a defendant in the Judges' Trial, where he was acquitted of the most serious charges, but was found guilty of a lesser charge of membership in a criminal organization (the SS).
