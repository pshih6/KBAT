The R채tikon is a mountain range of the Central Eastern Alps, located at the border between Vorarlberg, Liechtenstein and Graub체nden. It is the geological border between the Eastern and Western Alps and stretches from the Montafon as far as the Rhine. In the south, the Pr채ttigau is its limit, and in the north, it is the Walgau. In the east, it borders the Silvretta groups.
The R채tikon mountain range derives its name from Raetia, a province of the Roman Empire, named after the Rhaetian (Raeti or Rhaeti) people.
