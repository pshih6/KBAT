Oberstdorf (Low Alemannic: Oberschdorf) is a  municipality and skiing and hiking town in Germany, located in the Allg√§u region of the Bavarian Alps. It is the southernmost settlement in Germany and one of its highest towns.
At the center of Oberstdorf is a church whose tall spire serves as a landmark for navigating around town.  The summits of the Nebelhorn and Fellhorn provide dramatic panoramic views of the alps.  The Nebelhorn can be reached with a big cable car.  Visitors can ride a unique diagonal elevator to the top of the Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze.
