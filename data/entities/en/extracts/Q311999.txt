Ferruccio Lamborghini (Italian pronunciation: [ferˈruttʃo lamborˈgiːni]; 28 April 1916 – 20 February 1993) was an Italian industrialist. In 1963, he created Automobili Lamborghini, a maker of high-end sports cars in Sant'Agata Bolognese.
Born to grape farmers in Renazzo, from the comune of Cento in the Emilia-Romagna region, his mechanical know-how led him to enter the business of tractor manufacturing in 1948, when he founded Lamborghini Trattori, which quickly became an important manufacturer of agricultural equipment in the midst of Italy's post-WWII economic boom. In 1959, he opened an oil burner factory, Lamborghini Bruciatori, which later entered the business of producing air conditioning equipment.
Lamborghini founded a fourth company, Lamborghini Oleodinamica in 1969 after creating Automobili Lamborghini in 1963. Lamborghini sold off many of his interests by the late 1970s and retired to an estate in Umbria, where he pursued winemaking.
