Heather Anne Mills (born 12 January 1968) is an English former model, media personality, businesswoman and activist.
Mills came to public attention when she was a model in 1993 and was involved in a traffic collision with a police motorcycle in London. The accident resulted in the amputation of her left leg below the knee, but she continued to model by using a prosthetic limb and later sold her story to the tabloid News of the World.
Her relationship with Sir Paul McCartney brought further public attention in 2000. They married in June 2002 and Mills gave birth to Beatrice Milly McCartney on 28 October 2003. The couple separated in 2006 and finalised their divorce in 2008.
After her marriage to McCartney, Mills became involved in animal rights advocacy and as of 2012 is a patron of Viva! (Vegetarians' International Voice for Animals) and the Vegetarian and Vegan Foundation. She is also vice-president of the Limbless Association.
