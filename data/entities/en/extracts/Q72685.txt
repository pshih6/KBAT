Romuald Karmakar (born February 15, 1965) is a French film director, screenwriter and producer. He was born in Wiesbaden, Germany as the son of a Bengali father and a French mother. From 1977 to 1982 he lived in Athens. He has won several national and international awards, including the German National Film Award in Gold in 1996 for Der Totmacher (Deathmaker). His work has been honored with several retrospectives at festivals and cinematheques. In 2008, the MoMA celebrated his film Das Himmler-Projekt (The Himmler Project) as one of the top 250 most important artistic acquisitions of the Museum since 1980. A member of Akademie der Künste, Berlin (the Academy of the Arts, Berlin), Karmakar is internationally regarded for his honest representation of the less attractive aspects of society by focusing on those perpetrators responsible for these downfalls. Karmakar is currently a Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University (2012–13). He has been invited as one of the four artists (together with Ai Weiwei, Santu Mofokeng and Dayanita Singh) to represent Germany at the German Pavilion at the Art Venice Biennale in 2013.
