Henry Lewis Pittock (March 1, 1835 â€“ January 28, 1919) was an English-born American pioneer, publisher, newspaper editor, and wood and paper magnate. He was active in Republican politics and Portland, Oregon civic affairs, a Freemason and an avid outdoorsman and adventurer.  He is frequently referred to as the founder of The Oregonian, although it was an existing weekly before he reestablished it as the state's preeminent daily newspaper.
Pittock Mansion, a Renaissance revival mansion built by Pittock for himself and his wife, contemporarily operates as a museum chronicling his and his family's roles in the development of Portland.
