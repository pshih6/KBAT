Fritz Schulz (25 April 1896 – 9 May 1972) was a German and Austrian movie and stage actor, singer and director.
Born in Karlovy Vary (Karlsbad), Austria-Hungary, he appeared in almost one hundred movies between 1917 and 1970. Of Jewish extraction, Schultz fled the German film industry in Berlin at the onset of Nazism in 1933 and moved to Vienna to act in and direct independent Austrian film productions. He departed Austria as an exile upon the German Anschluss in 1938 and settled in Switzerland where he concentrated on his stage career until his death in Zürich in 1972.
He was married to actress Ágnes Esterházy from 1910 until her death in 1956.
