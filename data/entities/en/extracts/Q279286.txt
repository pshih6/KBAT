Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine is a 1965 American International Pictures comedy film, made in Path√©color, directed by Norman Taurog. It stars Vincent Price, Frankie Avalon, Dwayne Hickman, Susan Hart and Jack Mullaney, and features Fred Clark. It is a parody of the then-popular spy film trend (the title is a spoof of two James Bond films: the 1962 film Dr. No and the 1964 hit Goldfinger), made using actors from AIP's beach party and Edgar Allan Poe films.
Despite its low production values, the film has achieved a certain cult status for the appearance of horror legend Vincent Price and AIP's Beach Party film alumni, its in-jokes and over-the-top sexuality, the claymation title sequence designed by Art Clokey, and a title song performed by The Supremes.The movie was retitled Dr G. and the Bikini Machine in England: urban legend has it that this was because there were two doctors in the country called Doctor Goldfoot, but it was more likely due to a threatened lawsuit from Eon, holder of the rights to the James Bond movies.
The success of the film on its 1965 release led to a sequel, made the following year, entitled Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs.
