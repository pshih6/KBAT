Tarento (タレント) are celebrities who regularly appear in mass media in Japan, especially television. The term is a gairaigo word – a borrowed foreign language word – derived from the English word talent (Japanese does not distinguish /l/ and /r/ sounds), and has a connotation of "famous for being famous". During the Golden Age of Hollywood, bankable stars in America were described as talents, and were distinguished from production crews, which were seen as having more technical than charismatic talents. In Japan the concept of tarento may approximate  the English term celebrity, including the nuance that the fame of a Tarento may or may not be based upon specific accomplishments and abilities.
