Thomas Wedgwood (14 May 1771 â€“ 10 July 1805), son of Josiah Wedgwood, the potter, is most widely known as an early experimenter in the field of photography.
He is the first person known to have thought of creating permanent pictures by capturing camera images on material coated with a light-sensitive chemical. His practical experiments yielded only shadow image photograms that were not light-fast, but his conceptual breakthrough and partial success have led some historians to call him "the first photographer".
