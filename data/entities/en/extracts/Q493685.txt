The Centre Party (Norwegian: Senterpartiet, Sp) is an agrarian centrist political party in Norway. Founded in 1920 as a Nordic agrarian party, the Centre Party's policy is not based on any of the major ideologies of the 19th and 20th century, but has a focus on maintaining decentralised economic development and political decision-making.From its founding until 2000, the party joined only governments not led by the Labour Party (although it supported a Labour-government in the 1930s), but in 2005 turned around and joined the Red-Green coalition government led by the Labour Party. Governments headed by prime ministers from the party include the short-lived Kolstad and Hundseid's Cabinet between 1931 and 1933, and the longer-lasting Borten's Cabinet from 1965 until 1971.
The Centre Party has maintained a hardline stance against Norwegian membership in the European Union, successfully campaigning against Norwegian membership in both the 1972 and 1994 referendums, during which time the party saw record-high election results, which the party subsequently has extended to advocating Norway's withdrawal from the European Economic Area and the Schengen Agreement. The party favours an economically protectionist policy to protect Norwegian farmers with toll tariffs, and has more recently declared Norwegian nationalism a "positive force".
