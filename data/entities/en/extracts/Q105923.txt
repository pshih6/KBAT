Hugo von Trimberg (born circa 1230/1235 in Wern(a), now either Ober- or Niederwerrn near Schweinfurt â€“ died after 1313 in Bamberg-Theuerstadt) was a German Catholic didactic author of the Middle Ages.
Around 1260 he came to the religious foundation of St. Gangolf in the Bamberg suburb of Theuerstadt, where surviving documents mention him as a teacher . He later became Rector, which he remained until 1300 or so. He was noted in his own day, and is now remembered for his didactic writing, much of which was primarily aimed at his own students.
