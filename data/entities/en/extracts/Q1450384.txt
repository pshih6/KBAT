The Italian Radicals (Italian: Radicali Italiani, RI) is a liberal political party in Italy which describes itself as "liberale, liberista [and] libertario", where liberale refers to political liberalism, liberista denotes economic liberalism and libertario represents a form of cultural liberalism concerning moral issues.
From 2001 to 2017, the party intended to be the Italian section of the Transnational Radical Party (TRP) as the continuation of the Radical Party founded in 1955 by the left-wing of the Italian Liberal Party and re-launched in the 1960s by Marco Pannella. As the Radical Party had become a transnational NGO working mainly at the UN-level which by statute could not participate in national elections, its Italian members organised themselves into the Pannella List between 1992 and 1999 and the Bonino List until 2001, when they established the RI. In 2017, the TRP broke with the RI.
Founded on 14 July 2001 (with Daniele Capezzone as their first secretary), the RI are a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party. The party was previously a full member of the Liberal International. According to its constitution, the party "as such and with its symbol does not take part in elections".
