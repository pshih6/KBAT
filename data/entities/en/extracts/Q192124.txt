Abū Jaʿfar Muḥammad ibn Jarīr al-Ṭabarī (; Persian: محمد بن جریر طبری‎, Arabic: أبو جعفر محمد بن جرير بن يزيد الطبري‎) (224–310 AH; 839–923 AD) was an influential Iranian scholar, historian and exegete of the Qur'an from Amol, Tabaristan (modern Mazandaran Province of Iran), who composed all his works in Arabic.
Today, he is best known for his expertise in Qur'anic exegesis and Islamic jurisprudence but he has been described as "an  impressively prolific polymath. He wrote on such subjects as world history, poetry, lexicography, grammar, ethics, mathematics, and medicine."
Al-Tabari's madhhab flourished among Sunni ulama for two centuries after his death before it eventually became extinct. It was usually designated by the name Jariri.
