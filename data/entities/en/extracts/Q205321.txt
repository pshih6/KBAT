The Killers (also known as A Man Alone) is a 1946 American film noir directed by Robert Siodmak and based in part on the 1927 short story of the same name by Ernest Hemingway.It stars Burt Lancaster in his film debut, Ava Gardner, Edmond O'Brien and Sam Levene.  The film also features William Conrad in his first credited role, as one of the killers referred to in the title. An uncredited John Huston and Richard Brooks co-wrote the screenplay, which was credited to Anthony Veiller.
In 2008, The Killers was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
Hemingway, who was habitually disgusted with how Hollywood distorted his thematic intentions, was a fan of the 1946 film directed by Robert Siodmak, stating that "It is a good picture and the only good picture ever made of a story of mine."
