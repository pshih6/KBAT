The Jiusan Society (Chinese: 九三学社; literally: 'Nine-Three Academic Society') is one of the eight legally recognised political parties in the People's Republic of China that follow the direction of the Communist Party of China and are members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The party's original name was "Democracy and Science Forum", the current name refers to the date of Chinese victory in the Second Sino-Japanese War (September 3, 1945).
The party's mission statement is to "lead the nation to power and the people to prosperity," though this must be subordinate to the national interest. The party had a membership of 167,218 members by June 2016, mostly high- and medium-level intellectuals in the fields of science, technology, education, culture, and medicine.
