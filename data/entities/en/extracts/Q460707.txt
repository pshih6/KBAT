The Spectacular Spider-Man is an American animated television series based on the superhero character published by Marvel Comics and developed for television by Greg Weisman and Victor Cook. In terms of overall tone and style, the series is based principally on the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko and Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. runs on The Amazing Spider-Man, with a similar balance of action, drama and comedy as well as a high school setting. However, it also tends to blend material from all eras of the comic's run and other sources such as Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy and the Ultimate Spider-Man comics.The Spectacular Spider-Man premiered on March 8, 2008, during the Kids' WB programming block of The CW. The series aired its second season on Marvel's sister network Disney XD in the United States and ended its run on November 18, 2009. The entire series was broadcast in Canada on Teletoon. Although a third season was initially planned, the series was cancelled before production could begin due to legal problems between Disney (who purchased Marvel during the show's run) and Sony Pictures Television (who created the series).
Despite the legal troubles and cancellation, the series received widespread universal acclaim from both critics and fans, with much of the praise being aimed at the faithfulness and fidelity to the classic Spider-Man comics, the fresh, unique yet faithful re-imagining of classic Spider-Man concepts and themes, the unique art style, character designs, voice acting, writing, along with Josh Keaton's portrayal of the titular character, and the balance of comedy, drama, action and the exploration of surprisingly mature themes and the realistic insight into the titular character's internal struggles with the burden and the problems of being a superhero. Many have praised the series as being, arguably, the best adaptation of Spider-Man to date.
