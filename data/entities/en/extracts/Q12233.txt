It is a port city located east of Gij√≥n and west of Bilbao with a population of 172,000 (2017).It is believed to have been a port since ancient times, due to its favorable location, and is documented as far back as the 11th century.

Today, its remaining old town, beach and other attractions are popular with tourists and other visitors and its economy is mainly service based. The port is still very active and a regular ferry service operates to the United Kingdom. Fish and seafood dominate the local cuisine.
