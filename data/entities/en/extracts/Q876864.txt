A contributing editor is a newspaper, magazine or online job title that varies in its responsibilities. Often, but not always, a contributing editor is a 'high-end'  freelancer, consultant or expert who has proven ability and has readership draw.  This contributing editor would regularly contribute articles to the publication but does not always edit articles. Here the title "editor" implies a certain level of prestige, rather than a more traditional editing role. In other instances, however, a contributing editor may oversee projects or specific aspects of a publication and have more regular editing duties. At smaller magazines, the title can imply a staff member with regular writing responsibility and some editorial duties.  When a "contributing editor" is listed on the title page of a book, the term generally designates a person who has served as some kind of consultant in the book's preparation but who is not responsible for the book's final content.
