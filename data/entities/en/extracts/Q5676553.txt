The Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) is the engineering school within Harvard University's Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS). It offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in engineering and applied sciences (though its undergraduates are officially enrolled in Harvard College). Previously the Lawrence Scientific School and then the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the School assumed its current structure in 2007. Francis J. Doyle III has been the School's dean since 2015.In 2020 and 2021, SEAS will expand into the new Science and Engineering Complex (SEC) in Allston, across the Charles River from the main campus of Harvard. The SEC will be adjacent to the Enterprise Research Campus in synergy with Harvard Business School and Harvard Innovation Labs.Recent investments have enlarged the School's faculty and upgraded its facilities. In 2019, Harvard was ranked third worldwide for Engineering and Technology by Times Higher Education. The School has produced numerous research discoveries and many distinguished alumni.
