Kenneth Essex Edgeworth  (26 February 1880 â€“ 10 October 1972) was an Army officer, engineer, economist and independent theoretical astronomer. He was born 26 February 1880 in Street, County Westmeath. Edgeworth is best known for proposing the existence of a disc of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune in the 1930s. Observations later confirmed the existence of the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt in 1992. Today those distant solar system bodies including Pluto, Eris, and Makemake, are grouped into the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt, or Kuiper belt.
