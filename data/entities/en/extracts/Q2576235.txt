The Wilhelmsgymnasium is a gymnasium (selective school) in Munich, Germany. Founded in 1559 to educate local boys, it is now coeducational. 
Wilhelmsgymnasium is one of the few remaining gymnasium in Bavaria to be a "pure Humanistisches Gymnasium" (humanities gymnasium), meaning that it traditionally focuses on the Classics: all students are required to study Latin, English, and Ancient Greek, in addition to mainstream school subjects.
