The Kingdom of Seville (Spanish: Reino de Sevilla) was a territorial jurisdiction of the Crown of Castile since 1248 until Javier de Burgos' provincial division of Spain in 1833. This was a "kingdom" ("reino") in the second sense given by the Diccionario de la lengua espa침ola de la Real Academia Espa침ola: the Crown of Castile consisted of several such kingdoms. Seville was one of the Four Kingdoms of Andalusia. Its extent is detailed in Respuestas Generales del Catastro de Ensenada (1750-54), which was part of the documentation of a census. Falling largely within the present day autonomous community of Andalucia, it included roughly the territory of the present-day provinces of Huelva, Seville, and C치diz, the Antequera Depression in the present-day province of M치laga, and also some municipalities in the present-day autonomous communities of Extremadura in the province of Badajoz.
Like the other kingdoms within Spain, the Kingdom of Seville was abolished by the 1833 territorial division of Spain.
