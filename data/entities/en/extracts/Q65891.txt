Marly is a municipality in the district of Sarine in the canton of Fribourg in Switzerland. Its German name is Mertenlach, but this is no longer common, although still in regional use. It was formed through the 1970 merger of Marly-le-Grand and Marly-le-Petit and the 1976 addition of the former municipality of Ch√©salles.
