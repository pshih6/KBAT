Walter Kaufmann (born 19 January 1924 in Berlin) is a German-Australian writer of Polish origin.
Kaufmann (born Jizchak Schmeidler), son of a Polish-Jewish woman called Rachela Schmeidler, was adopted by the wealthy German-Jewish couple Dr. Sally and Johanna Kaufmann at the age of three. While his adoptive parents were eventually murdered in Auschwitz, Kaufmann fled to England during the outbreak of the War, and was later deported to Australia on the infamous ship HMT Dunera in 1940. He soon joined the Australian army as a volunteer. After the war and demobilisation he worked in different environments and various jobs at the same time trying to further his education.Kaufmann joined the Melbourne Realist Writers' Group and had some of his stories published in the Realist Writer. He became politically active and travelled extensively. He was encouraged by writers such as Frank Hardy and David Martin to write a novel based on his own past in Nazi Germany (Voices in the Storm). Later Kaufmann settled in the East Berlin and continued publishing in English and German.Kaufmann's schematic socialist realistic stories on the struggles of Australian trade unionists and the disenfranchisement of the Aborigines, became very popular in the GDR after his return to East Berlin in 1957.
