Robert James Ritchie Sr. (born January 17, 1971), known professionally as Kid Rock and Bobby Shazam, is an American singer-songwriter, rapper, disc jockey, musician, record producer, and actor. In a career spanning 30 years, Rock's musical style alternates between rock, hip hop, and country. A multi-instrumentalist, he has overseen his own production on nine of his eleven studio albums.
Kid Rock started his professional music career as a self-taught rapper and DJ, releasing his debut album Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast in 1990 on Jive Records; his subsequent independent releases The Polyfuze Method (1993) and Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp (1996) saw him developing a more distinctive style which was fully realized on his 1998 album Devil Without a Cause (1998), his breakthrough album, which sold 14 million copies. Devil Without a Cause and his subsequent album, Cocky (2001), were noted for blending elements of hip hop, country, rock and heavy metal. Starting with his 2010 album Born Free, the country music style has dominated his musical direction. He has not rapped on his albums since the 2003 album Kid Rock, with the exception of one track each on Rock n Roll Jesus (2007) and Sweet Southern Sugar (2017).
