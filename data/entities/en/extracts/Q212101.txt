The Social Democrats (Danish: Socialdemokraterne, pronounced [soˈɕɛˀlte̝moˌkʰʁɑˀtɐnə]), officially the Social Democratic Party or simply Social Democracy (Danish: Socialdemokratiet, pronounced [soˈɕɛˀlte̝mokʰʁɑˌtsʰiˀð̩]), is a social-democratic political party in Denmark.Founded by Louis Pio in 1871, the party first entered the Folketing in the 1884 elections. By the early 20th century, it had become the party with the largest representation in the Folketing, a distinction it would hold for 77 years. It first formed a government after the 1924 elections under Thorvald Stauning, the longest-serving Danish Prime Minister of the 20th century. During Stauning's government which lasted until the 1926 elections, the Social Democrats exerted a profound influence on Danish society, laying the foundation of the Danish welfare state. From 2002 to 2016, the party used the name Socialdemokraterne in some contexts.The party was the major coalition partner in government from the 2011 elections, with then-party leader Helle Thorning-Schmidt as Prime Minister. After the 2015 elections, the party was no longer in government, although it regained the position as the largest party in the Danish parliament, the Folketing, with 47 of 179 seats. Thorning-Schmidt withdrew as party leader on the night of the election as a direct consequence of the loss of government control and she was succeeded on 28 June 2015 by the former vice leader Mette Frederiksen, who shifted the party back to the left on economics while criticising mass immigration.A member of the Party of European Socialists, the Social Democrats have three MEPs in the European Parliament.
