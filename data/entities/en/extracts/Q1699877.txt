John Edward "Jack" Cunningham III (born March 27, 1931) is a former Republican U.S. Representative from Washington's seventh district. Prior to that, Cunningham served in the Washington House of Representatives from 1973 to 1975, and in the Washington Senate from 1975 to 1977. He served in the United States Air Force Reserve in 1953 and 1954. Cunningham lived in Des Moines, Washington.
Cunningham was elected as a Republican to the seventh district vacancy in a special election when U.S. Representative Brock Adams resigned to become Secretary of Transportation. However his victory in this liberal district was more the result of confusion with Adams's resignation. Cunningham lost reelection in 1978, and served from May 17, 1977 â€“ January 3, 1979.
