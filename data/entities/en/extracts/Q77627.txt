Ludwig Henrich Friedlaender (July 16, 1824 – December 16, 1909) was a German philologist. He was one of the preeminent scholars of Ancient Rome of his time and is known for his research on Roman daily life and customs. He was a Professor at Albertina and served as its Rector 1865/66 and 1874/5. He was also a member of the House of Lords.
He was born in Königsberg, and studied at the universities of his hometown Königsberg, Leipzig, and Berlin from 1841 to 1845. In 1847 he became privat-docent of classical philology at Königsberg, in 1856 assistant professor, and in 1858 professor.
He retired in 1892 to Strasbourg, where he was honorary professor at the university, and died there.
He was a son of the merchant Hirsch Friedländer (1791–1871) and Emma Levia Perlbach (1801–1863), and was raised Jewish. He later converted to Protestantism. In 1856, he married Laura Gutzeit, daughter of an East Prussian estate owner. Their son Paul Friedländer was a noted chemist. Their daughter Charlotte Friedländer was married to the art historian Georg Dehio.
