The Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques (French pronunciation: ​[akademi de sjɑ̃s mɔʁal e pɔlitik], Academy of Moral and Political Sciences) is a French learned society. It is one of the five academies of the Institut de France.
The Académie was founded in 1795, suppressed in 1803, and reestablished in 1832 through the appeal of Guizot to King Louis Philippe. It is divided into five sections and has for its chief purpose the discussion of mental philosophy, law and jurisprudence, political economy and statistics, general and philosophical history, and politics, administration, and finance.  It distributes the Baujour, Faucher, Halphen, Bordin, and other prizes, publishes Mémoires, and holds its annual meeting each December.
