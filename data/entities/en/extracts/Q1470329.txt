The Victor Talking Machine Company was an American record company and phonograph manufacturer headquartered in Camden, New Jersey.
The company was founded by engineer Eldridge R. Johnson, who had previously made gramophones to play Emile Berliner's disc records. After a series of legal wranglings between Berliner, Johnson and their former business partners, the two joined to form the Consolidated Talking Machine Co. in order to combine the patents for the record with Johnson's patents improving its fidelity. Victor Talking Machine Co. was incorporated officially on October 3, 1901 shortly before agreeing to allow Columbia Records use of its disc record patent.
