János Erdélyi (1814 in Veľké Kapušany – January 23, 1868 in Sárospatak) was a Hungarian poet, critic, author, philosopher and ethnographist.
He was born in 1814 at Veľké Kapušany (Slovakia), in the county of Ung, and educated at the Protestant college of Sárospatak.

His literary fame was made by his collection of Hungarian national poems and folk-tales, Magyar népköltési gyűjtemény, népdalok és mondák ("Collection of Hungarian Folklore, Folk Songs and Tales", Pest, 1846–1847).
