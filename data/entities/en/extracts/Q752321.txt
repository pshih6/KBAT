Magical girl (Japanese: 魔法 少女, Hepburn: mahō shōjo) is a subgenre of Japanese fantasy light novels, manga, anime, and video games which features girls who use magic or possess magical powers. Magical girls transform to unlock their powers and are often accompanied by an animal mascot, using wands or scepters as a weapon to fight monsters and the forces of evil. Notable examples include Sally the Witch and Cardcaptor Sakura.
