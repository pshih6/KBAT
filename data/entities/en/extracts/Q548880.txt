Marcelo Gonçalves Costa Lopes, usually known simply as Gonçalves (born 22 February 1966 in Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro state) is a Brazilian former footballer who played as a central defender. He was effective on low balls, and was well known because of his long hair, a recognisable hairstyle which he wore for most of his career, and which he only cut during the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup, when all the Brazilian players entered the field in the semifinal match with shaved heads.
