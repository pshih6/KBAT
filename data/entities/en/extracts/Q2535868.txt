Ván Records is a German record label based in Herzogenrath. It was founded in 2004 by Sven Dinninghoff, who was a member of Black Metal bands Nagelfar and Graupel in the mid-1990s. The label was founded in the environment of Wòd-Ván, an association of Black Metal fans near Aachen, which was founded by Dinninghoff and other members of Nagelfar. Under contract are mainly German and Dutch bands, but also American bands like Škan or Svartidauði from Iceland.
