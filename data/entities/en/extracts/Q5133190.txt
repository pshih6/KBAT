Clifton College is a co-educational independent school in the suburb of Clifton in the city of Bristol in South West England, founded in 1862. In its early years it was notable (compared with most public schools of the time) for emphasising science rather than classics in the curriculum, and for being less concerned with social elitism, e.g. by admitting day-boys on equal terms and providing a dedicated boarding house for Jewish boys, called Polacks. Having linked its General Studies classes with Badminton School, it admitted girls to the Sixth Form in 1987 and is now fully coeducational. Polacks house closed in 2005.
It was at Clifton that the second-highest cricket score ever recorded was made by 13-year-old A. E. J. Collins in June 1899. Collins was killed in the First World War, but his 628 not out stood as the record score till January 2016, when Pranav Dhanawade, 15 years old, of Mumbai, India, scored 1009 in a school game.
The school was also the headquarters of the US army in Britain for part of the Second World War.
Clifton is one of the original 26 English public schools as defined by the Public Schools Yearbook of 1889.
