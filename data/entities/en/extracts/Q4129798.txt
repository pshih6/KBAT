The Advanced Course for Screenwriters and Film Directors (Russian: Высшие курсы сценаристов и режиссёров (ВКСР)) is a graduate or post-graduate course at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography (VGIK) in Moscow, Russia. Formerly state-funded it is now independent from the state educational establishment in Russia offering professional education in cinematography, screenwriting, production and direction. Established in 1963 in the Soviet Union, but tracing its history back to 1956, the Advanced Course is the oldest professional qualification in the cinematographic arts in Russia for people with relevant higher education qualifications.
