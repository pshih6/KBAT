Abu Bakr Abdullah al-Qirbi (Arabic: أبو بكر القربي‎) is a Yemeni diplomat who was Minister of Foreign Affairs of Yemen from 2001 to 2014.

On 13 December 2009, al-Qirbi urged Iran's government to crack down on Iranian groups who he accused of aiding Houthi rebels in northern Yemen, holding the Iranian government partly to blame. According to al-Qirbi, "religious (Shiite) circles and groups in Iran are providing aid to the Houthis"; however, Iran repeatedly denied such accusations.Following the anti-government protests in Yemen, President Ali Abdullah Saleh dismissed all members of the Cabinet of Yemen on March 20, 2011. They were to remain as serving members until a new government was formed.On 4 October 2016, during the Civil War, he was appointed as foreign minister in the Abdel-Aziz bin Habtour's cabinet.
