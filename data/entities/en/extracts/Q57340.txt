Mswati III (born Makhosetive; 19 April 1968) is the king (Swazi: Ngwenyama, Ingwenyama yemaSwati) of Eswatini and head of the Swazi Royal Family. He was born in Manzini in the Protectorate of Swaziland to King Sobhuza II and one of his younger wives, Ntfombi Tfwala. He was crowned as Mswati III, Ingwenyama and King of Swaziland, on 25 April 1986 at the age of 18, thus becoming the youngest ruling monarch in the world at that time. Together with his mother, Ntfombi Tfwala, now Queen Mother (Ndlovukati), he rules the country as an absolute monarch. Mswati III is known for his practice of polygamy (although at least two wives are appointed by the state) and currently has 15 wives. His policies and lavish lifestyle have led to local protests and international criticism.In April 2020, he was reported to have been admitted to hospital with breathing difficulties, and, as of 13 April, to be in a critical condition. In March, Mswati III had come into contact with visiting Taiwanese soldiers, two of whom were later quarantined for COVID-19. The Eswatini government claimed that the reports were "fake news".
