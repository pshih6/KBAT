Friedrich Philipp Dulk (22 November 1788 in Stallupönen – 14 December 1851 in Königsberg) was a German pharmacist and chemist. He was the father of writer Albert Dulk (1819–1884) and father-in-law to mathematician Otto Hesse.
He studied law at the University of Königsberg, and in the meantime received training in pharmacy from his brother. In 1812 he qualified as a pharmacist in Berlin, and three years later, took charge of his brother's pharmacy. In 1825 he obtained his habilitation and in 1833 became a full professor of chemistry at the University of Königsberg. In 1847 he was elected a delegate to the Prussian Landtag.
