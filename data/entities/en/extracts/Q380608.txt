Paul William Scott Anderson (born 4 March 1965) is an English film director, producer, and screenwriter who regularly works in science fiction films and video game adaptations.
Anderson made his feature film debut with the British independent film Shopping (1994), and found commercial success with his second film, the Hollywood-produced Mortal Kombat (1995), based on the first couple of video games of the same name by Midway Games. Today, he is best known as the creative voice behind the Resident Evil film series (2002â€“2016), which stars his eventual wife Milla Jovovich, and is based on the Capcom video game series of the same name. The series consists of six films, of which Anderson directed four, that have collectively grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it the most commercially successful video game adaptation to this date. Other notable films of Anderson's are Event Horizon (1997), an initial critical and commercial disappointment that found renewed appreciation on home video; Alien vs. Predator (2004), based on the crossover concept of the same name between the Alien and Predator franchises; and Death Race (2008), a remake/prequel to 1975's Death Race 2000.
Anderson and producer Jeremy Bolt founded Impact Pictures in 1992, under which most of Anderson's films have been made.
