The Paper Chase is a 1973 film starring Timothy Bottoms, Lindsay Wagner, and John Houseman, and directed by James Bridges.
Based on John Jay Osborn Jr.'s 1971 novel The Paper Chase, it tells the story of James Hart, a first-year law student at Harvard Law School, his experiences with Professor Charles Kingsfield, a brilliant and demanding contract law instructor, and Hart's relationship with Kingsfield's daughter. Houseman earned an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as the professor. Houseman later reprised the role in a TV series of the same name that lasted four seasons (following Hart, played by James Stephens, through his three years of law school).
