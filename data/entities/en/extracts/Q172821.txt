John Martin James (10 May 1914 â€“ 27 January 2002) was a British racing driver from England. He competed in one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix. James was an engineer who acquired a Maserati 4CLT/48, and entered the 1951 British Grand Prix, retiring from a damaged radiator after 23 laps. Regulation changes for 1952 limited his Maserati to competing in Formula Libre only, and he competed in several sprint races before retiring from racing.
