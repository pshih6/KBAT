This Saturday-morning cartoon series featured teenagers Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, and Norville "Shaggy" Rogers and their talking brown Great Dane named Scooby-Doo who solve mysteries involving supposedly supernatural creatures through a series of antics and mis-steps.Following the success of the original series, Hanna-Barbera and its successor Warner Bros. Animation have produced numerous follow-up and spin-off animated series and several related works, including television specials and made-for-TV movies, a line of direct-to-video films, and two Warner Bros.â€“produced theatrical feature films. Some versions of Scooby-Doo feature variations on the show's supernatural theme and include characters such as Scooby's cousin Scooby-Dum and nephew Scrappy-Doo in addition to some of the original characters.
