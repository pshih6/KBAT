Akiko Dōmoto (堂本 暁子, Dōmoto Akiko, born July 31, 1932) was the governor of Chiba Prefecture in Japan from 2001 to 2009. A graduate of Tokyo Woman's Christian University, she was the first female governor of Chiba and the third in Japanese history. She was first elected in 2001. In September 2001 she canceled a controversial plan to reclaim the Sanbanze wetlands as landfill. Historian Jeff Kingston called this act "a major victory for activists."
