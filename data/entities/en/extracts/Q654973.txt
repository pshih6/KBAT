Primo Mazzolari (13 January 1890 â€“ 12 April 1959), best known as don Primo, was an Italian priest of the Catholic Church. He was also a partisan and writer who established the review Adesso ("Now") in 1949.
Known as the priest of Bozzolo, he was one of the most striking people of Italian Catholicism in the first part of the 20th century. His thoughts anticipated some of the orientations of the Second Vatican Council, especially about the "Church of the Poor", religious freedom, and pluralism.From the start of the 1950s, don Primo developed a social doctrine with a close empathy towards the disadvantaged (where a lot of people depend on charity) and pacifism, which earned him criticism and sanctions from the ecclesiastical authorities and led him to be marginalized in his own parish of Bozzolo.
In 1955, with the anonymous publication of Tu non-uccidere (You, don't kill), don Primo attacked the doctrine of just war and the ideology of victory, in the name of nonviolence, to support a Movement "... of Christian resistance against war ..." and for justice and peace.
It was only at the end of 1950s, in the last months of his life, that don Primo began to receive the first approval of the ecclesiastical authorities. In November 1957, the archbishop of Milan Montini, future pope Paul VI, called on him to preach in his diocese.
In February 1959, pope John XXIII received him in a private audience and publicly called him "Tromba dello spirito santo nella Bassa Padana" (Trumpet of the Holy Spirit in Bassa Padana).Pope Francis visited Bozzolo and gave a speech and prayed at his tomb, meeting with members of Fondazione (Foundation) Mazzolari and its President, and a scientist who is a professor and member of the Fondazione Mazzolari, as part of a one-day helicopter pilgrimage in Italy, on 20 June 2017, to Bozzolo, and to Barbiana (to visit the area of Don (Father) Lorenzo Milani.
