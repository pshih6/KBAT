The LDPR — Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (Russian: ЛДПР — Либерально-демократическая партия России, Liberalno-demokratitcheskaïa partiïa Rossii), briefly,  the LDPR or Liberal Democratic Party, is a socially conservative, nationalist, economically interventionist political party in Russia led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky since its founding in 1989.
Opposing both communism and neoliberal capitalism of the 1990s, the party scored a major success in the 1993 Russian Duma elections, receiving a plurality of votes. In the elections in 2016, the party received 13.14% of the vote, giving it 39 of the 450 seats in the State Duma.
Despite the party's name, it is frequently described as "neither liberal nor democratic". The party has been described as fiscally statist within an ultranationalist authoritarian ideology. Its ideology is based primarily on Zhirinovsky's ideas of "imperial reconquest" (a "renewed Russian Empire") and on an authoritarian vision of a "Greater Russia".
