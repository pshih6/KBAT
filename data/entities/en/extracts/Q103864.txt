Klaus Heinrich (born September 23, 1927) is a German philosopher of religion. In 2002, he was awarded the Sigmund Freud Prize by the Deutsche Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung.
At the Freie Universität in Berlin, founded in 1948, a chair in "the study of religion on the basis of the philosophy of religion" was created for Heinrich. Michael Stausberg, historian of the study of religion, says this of him:
“Heinrich became famous in Berlin and beyond for his skills as an orator—being a speaker rather than a writer, many of his publications are reconstructed on the basis of recordings and notes of his students—, his teaching style, his immense learning and his political commitment to the ideals of a ‘free’ university. His work, which adopts key-elements from Tillich (‘origins’) and Freud (‘repression’), moves in the borderland between Greek mythology (Oedipus!) and philosophy. Many of his texts provide a philosophical-psychoanalytical exegesis of myths that takes visual culture (modern arts, the Renaissance) as its point of departure. Heinrich's dense style, often difficult to follow for the non-initiates, won him the prestigious Sigmund Freud-Award for Scientific Prose in 2002. Heinrich's approach to the study of religion is too unique and personal to be copied by others, but he had many students who were fascinated by his charisma.”See also Irion, U. “Religiosität ohne Religion.
