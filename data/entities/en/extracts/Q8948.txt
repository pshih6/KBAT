Arnošt Muka (German: Ernst Mucke; 10 March 1854 – 10 October 1932) was a German and Sorbian writer, linguist and man of science.
Muka was born in Großhänchen which is now in the municipality of Burkau, and studied theology, classical languages and Slavonic in Leipzig. Because of his activities in connection with the Sorbian languages, he was sent to teach in a gymnasium in Chemnitz in 1883, and later to Freiberg. In 1917, he moved back to Bautzen, where he died on 10 October 1932.
