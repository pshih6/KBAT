Vladimir Bogdanovich Rezun (Russian: Владимир Богданович Резун; born 20 April 1947), known by his pseudonym of Viktor Suvorov (Виктор Суворов), became known as a Russian writer on Soviet military history after he defected to the United Kingdom in 1978. Of Russian-Ukrainian ancestry, Suvorov attended Russian military schools, was a veteran of the armed forces (including the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia), and had worked as a Soviet military intelligence officer in the Soviet Union.  
While next working as an intelligence agent for the UK, Suvorov began his writing career, publishing his first non-fiction books in the 1980s about his own experiences and the structure of Soviet military, intelligence, and secret police. He writes in Russian. 
Among his later works is Icebreaker (1990), in which he argued that Joseph Stalin planned to use Nazi Germany as a proxy in World War II to establish Soviet control in Europe. He also wrote several follow-up books on the history of the war. Historians have disputed his assertion that Operation Barbarossa was a preemptive strike by Hitler.
