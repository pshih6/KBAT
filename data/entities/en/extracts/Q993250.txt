Bruno Frei (real name,  Benedikt Freistadt:  11 June 1897 – 21 May 1988) was a political (Marxist) author and journalist. He was born in Preßburg which at that time was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and the family moved to Vienna in 1909. Following the frontier changes mandated in 1919, he spent much of his adult life and career in that city, although he spent six of the Hitler years exiled in Mexico.Sources most frequently name him as Bruno Frei, but he is also sometimes identified as Karl Franz, a pseudonym under which some of his work was published.
