Bad Saarow (Lower Sorbian: Zarow) is a municipality in the Oder-Spree district, in Brandenburg, Germany.
The place is known for its hot springs and for its mineral-rich mud. Their healing properties have attracted visitors for many years, and in 1923 led to the town's name acquiring the prefix Bad ("bath", "spa").
Nearby are the Dubrower Berge, a range of wooded hills popular with hikers and cyclists.
