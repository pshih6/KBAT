Princess Kishi (929–985, 徽子女王, also Yoshiko Joō 承香殿女御 Jokyōden Joō or 斎宮女御 Saigū no Nyōgo) was a Japanese Waka poet of the middle Heian period.  She is one of only five women numbered as one of the Thirty-six Poetry Immortals. As her name implies, she was a princess of the Imperial Family of Japan.
Many of her poems are included in the third Japanese imperial poetry anthology, Shūi Wakashū, issued in 1006.
