La Traversée de Paris ("the trip across Paris") is a 1956 French comedy-drama directed by Claude Autant-Lara, starring Jean Gabin, Bourvil and Louis de Funès. The film is known under the titles: "Four Bags Full" (USA), "Pig Across Paris" (UK), "The Trip Across Paris" (International English title). It is set in occupied Paris in 1942 and tells the story of two men who defy the curfew to deliver pork for the black market. The film is based on the short story "La traversée de Paris" by Marcel Aymé.
The film competed at the 17th Venice International Film Festival, where Bourvil won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor. The cynical portrayal of the occupation era was unconventional and made the film controversial upon the original release.
