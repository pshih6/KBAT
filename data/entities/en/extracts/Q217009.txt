The Socialist Revolutionary Party, or Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries (the SRs or Esers; Russian: Партия социалистов-революционеров (ПСР), эсеры, esery) was a major political party in early 20th century Imperial Russia.
A key player in the Russian Revolution, the SRs' general ideology was revolutionary socialism of democratic socialist and agrarian socialist forms. After the February Revolution, it shared power with social democratic, liberal, and other democratic socialist forces within the Russian Provisional Government. Following the October Revolution, in November 1917, the Socialist Revolutionary Party won a plurality of the national vote in Russia's first-ever democratic elections (to the Russian Constituent Assembly), however the results were nullified because the Bolsheviks had conducted a coup against the provisional government in October 1917. The Bolsheviks disbanded the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.
