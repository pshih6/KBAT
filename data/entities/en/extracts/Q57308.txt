Abdelaziz Bouteflika (pronunciation ; Arabic: عبد العزيز بوتفليقة‎, romanized: ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz Būtaflīqa [ʕabd lʕziːz buːtfliːqa]; born 2 March 1937) is an Algerian politician who served as President of Algeria for 20 years, from 1999 to his resignation in 2019.
As President, he presided over the end of the bloody Algerian Civil War in 2002 when he took over the project of Liamine Zéroual (previous president), and he ended emergency rule in February 2011 amidst regional unrest. Prior to becoming president, he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1963 until 1979 and as President of the United Nations General Assembly for a 1-year term from 1974.
Bouteflika resigned on 2 April 2019 after months of mass protests. With nearly 20 years in power, he was the longest-serving head of state of Algeria.
