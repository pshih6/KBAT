To the Ends of the Earth is a three-part BBC television miniseries adaptation of the trilogy of novels of the same name by William Golding. It premiered in the United Kingdom on BBC Two in July 2005, and in the United States on PBS as part of Masterpiece Theatre in October 2006.
Starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Jared Harris, the series was critically acclaimed with The New York Times calling it "an intriguing drama" and The Guardian "the best TV drama of the year by a nautical mile."A BBC press release quoted Cumberbatch's description of the series as "...a sort of rock and roll 1812 period drama about a young man’s gap year. It’s full of filth, dirt, discovery, sex, drugs, dancing, love, spiritual awakenings and massive sweeping changes!”
