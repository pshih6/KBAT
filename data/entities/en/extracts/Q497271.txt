Eric Ivan Cantor (born June 6, 1963) is a former American politician and lawyer who served as the United States representative for Virginia's 7th congressional district from 2001 until 2014. As a member of the Republican Party, he became House Majority Leader when the 112th Congress convened on January 3, 2011. He previously served as House Minority Whip from 2009 until 2011.
His district included most of the northern and western sections of Richmond, along with most of Richmond's western suburbs and, until redistricting in 2013, portions of the Shenandoah Valley. Cantor was the highest-ranking Jewish member of Congress in its history, and at the time of his resignation, the only non-Christian Republican in either house.In June 2014, in his bid for re-election, Cantor lost the Republican primary to economics professor Dave Brat in an upset that greatly surprised political analysts. In response Cantor announced his early resignation as House Majority Leader, and several weeks later, he announced his resignation from Congress, which took effect August 18, 2014. Immediately thereafter, Cantor accepted a position as vice chairman of investment bank Moelis & Company.
