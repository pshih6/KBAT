Muhammad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (4 March 1910 –  25 November 1988) (Arabic: محمد بن عبدالعزيز أل سعود‎) was a member of the House of Saud.
Briefly Crown Prince from 1964 to 1965, he was among the wealthiest and most powerful members of the Saudi royal family. His advice was sought and deferred to in all matters by his brothers. Until his death in 1988, he was a close and powerful confidant and senior adviser to his younger full brother, King Khalid (r. 1975–1982), and his younger half-brother, King Fahd (r. 1982–2005).
