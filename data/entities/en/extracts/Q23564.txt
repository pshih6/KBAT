Podgorica (UK: , US: ; Montenegrin Cyrillic and Serbian Cyrillic: Подгорица, pronounced [pǒdɡoritsa]; lit. '"[area] below Gorica"', Gorica being the name of a hillock overlooking the city) is the capital and largest city of Montenegro.
Between 1946 and 1992—in the period that Montenegro formed, as the Socialist Republic of Montenegro, part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY)—the city was known as Titograd (Montenegrin Cyrillic: Титоград [tîtoɡraːd]) in honour of Josip Broz Tito.
Podgorica's favourable position at the confluence of the Ribnica and Morača rivers and at the meeting-point of the fertile Zeta Plain and Bjelopavlići Valley has encouraged settlement. The city is close to winter skiing centres in the north and to seaside resorts on the Adriatic Sea.
Podgorica Municipality covers 10.4% of Montenegro's territory and is home to 29.9% of the country's population. It is the nation's administrative centre and its economic, cultural, and educational focus.
