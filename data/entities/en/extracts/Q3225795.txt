The Pornographers is a 1966 Japanese film directed by Shohei Imamura and based on a novel (Erogotoshitachi) by Akiyuki Nosaka. Its original Japanese title is "Erogotoshitachi" yori Jinruigaku nyūmon (「エロ事師たち」より 人類学入門), which means 'An introduction to anthropology through the pornographers'. It tells the story of porn film-maker Mr. Subuyan Ogata, whose business is under threat from thieves, the government, and his own family.
The film is a dark comic satire, depicting the underbelly of the Japanese post-war economic miracle, in this case pornographers and small-time gangsters in Osaka. It has been called Imamura's best-known film outside Japan.
