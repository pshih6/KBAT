Wolf Hoffmann (born 10 December 1959) is a German guitarist, primarily known as guitarist and the last remaining original member in the German heavy metal band Accept since 1976. In 1997, he released the album Classical with rock versions of classical pieces. He contributed to Skid Row vocalist Sebastian Bach's solo album Bring 'Em Bach Alive! and to a 2000 Japanese tribute to Randy Rhoads album called Randy Rhoads Tribute with Sebastian Bach on "I Don't Know" and with Joe Lynn Turner on "Diary of a Madman". Hoffmann also contributed to Peace Breaker by Skew Siskin.
Hoffmann has loved photography as a hobby early on, and eventually made it his second career. He took the cover photo for Objection Overruled. During Accept's hiatus from 1997, Hoffmann has worked as a professional photographer (website listed below). He is currently based in Nashville, TN, United States but also maintains a residence in Berlin, Germany.
Wolf Hoffmann is married to Gaby Hoffmann (n√©e Hauke), who used to be Accept's manager. She contributed to Accept's songwriting under the pseudonym Deaffy.
Accept reformed with Hoffmann on board in 2009. Their comeback album, Blood of the Nations, was released on 20 August 2010 to overwhelmingly positive reviews. Three follow-up albums, Stalingrad, Blind Rage and The Rise of Chaos were released successively since then.
On 27 November 2015, during an Accept show in London, Hoffmann revealed in an interview with Blackdiamond that he was working on a new solo album, which will probably be another in the neoclassical metal style, as his previous solo album  Classical was. He also stated that this album will probably be ready to be released in 2015 but did not mention a certain time. This album turned out to be Headbangers Symphony and released on 1 July 2016.
