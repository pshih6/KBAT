Marcus Geganius Macerinus was a Roman statesman who served as Consul in 447 BC, 443 BC, and 437 BC. In his first consulate, according to Livy, he and Gaius Julius Iulus concerned themselves with easing the tensions between the classes. In his second consulate he relieved Ardea from Volscian attacks, made Cloelius his prisoner, and celebrated a triumph. In his third Geganius fought the Veientes south of the Anio, and although he defeated his foe the victory came at heavy loss for the Romans.
