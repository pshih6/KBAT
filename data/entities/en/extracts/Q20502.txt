House is a genre of electronic dance music characterized by a repetitive four on the floor beat and a tempo of 120 to 130 beats per minute. It was created by DJs and music producers from Chicago's underground club culture in the 1980s, as DJs from the subculture began altering disco dance tracks to give them a more mechanical beat and deeper basslines.The genre was pioneered by DJs and producers mainly from Chicago and New York such as Frankie Knuckles, Larry Levan, Ron Hardy, Jesse Saunders, Chip E., Steve "Silk" Hurley, Farley "Jackmaster" Funk, Mr. Fingers, Marshall Jefferson, Phuture, and many others. Its origins derive from within the Black American LGBT communities but has since spread to the mainstream. From its beginnings in the Chicago club and local radio scene, the genre expanded internationally to London, then to other American cities such as New York City and Detroit, and has become a worldwide phenomenon ever since. It has spawned numerous subgenres, such as acid house, deep house, hip house, ghetto house, progressive house, tech house, electro house, and many more.
House has had and still has a huge impact on pop music in general and dance music in particular. It was picked up by major pop artists like Janet Jackson, Madonna, and Kylie Minogue, but also produced some mainstream hits on its own, such as "French Kiss" by Lil Louis (1989), "Show Me Love" by Robin S. (1992), or "Push the Feeling On" by Nightcrawlers (1992/1995). Many house producers also did and do remixes for pop artists. Until today, house music remained popular on radio and in clubs while retaining a foothold on the underground scenes across the globe.
