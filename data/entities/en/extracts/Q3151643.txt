The Inspectorate General of Finances or Inspection générale des finances (IGF) is an interdepartmental auditing and supervisory body in France. Its general mission is to provide oversight, audit, analysis, consulting, and evaluation services in administrative, economic, and financial matters. In the recent years, the IGF has been at the head of the movement of modernization of the state (in particular through its leading role in the General Review of Public Policies).
It is currently run by Marie-Christine Lepetit. It is placed under the joint responsibility of the Ministry for Economy, Finance, and Industry and the Ministry for Budget, Public Accounts and State Reform. Yet, because it is an interdepartmental body, it carries out missions for many ministries.
The General Inspection of Finances is not only a state body; it has been one of the Grand Corps of the French State since the 18th century. A small but influential corps, the IGF enjoys a particular prestige: each year it recruits some of the best students graduating from the highly regarded École nationale d'administration, and career opportunities after leaving the IGF are very good in both public and private sectors.
