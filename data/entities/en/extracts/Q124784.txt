Daniele Ganser (born August 29, 1972 in Lugano) is a Swiss historian. He became known in Europe with his 2005 book NATO's Secret Armies, an adaption of his 2001 dissertation. Since then he has published, among other things, on open and covert military actions of NATO countries, which he describes as being contrary to international law, as well as on the global maximum production of crude oil. He picks up on various conspiracy theories, especially on 9/11 and presents them as explanatory approaches still to be examined by scientists. Since September 2019, he holds that the Hulsey study has scientifically proven that only a controlled demolition by explosives can explain the destruction of World Trade Center 7.
