Ivan Slavkov (Bulgarian: Иван Славков) (11 May 1940, Sofia – 1 May 2011) was a Bulgarian sports boss linked to the Communist-era nomenklatura. He served as the President of the Bulgarian Olympic Committee (BOC) between 1982 and 2005 and was a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) between 1987 and 2005.
During the Communist regime in Bulgaria, Slavkov married Lyudmila Zhivkova, daughter of Bulgaria's Communist leader Todor Zhivkov. Despite his unclear qualifications, he was appointed head of the state-controlled Bulgarian Television in 1972.
In 1982 Slavkov left Bulgarian television and became the President of the Bulgarian Olympic Committee.
