Ettore Ovazza (21 March 1892, in Turin â€“ 11 October 1943, in Intra) was an Italian Jewish banker. Believing that his privileged position would be restored after the war, Ovazza stayed on after the Germans marched into Italy.  Together with his wife and children, he was killed near the Swiss border by SS troops in 1943, shortly after the collapse of Mussolini's government during World War II.
