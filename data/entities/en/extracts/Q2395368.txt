Carlos Hank González (1927–2001), nicknamed El Profesor ("The Professor"), was a Mexican politician and influential businessman. Originally a teacher, he was an entrepreneur who built political contacts along with a business empire, leading to various government and political positions at the state (State of Mexico) and national level. He was prevented from seeking the presidency due to laws requiring both parents to be Mexicans by birth; his father was German. He became a main powerbroker of then ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and was regarded as "the most powerful fixture in Mexican politics for 30 years because his influence extended beyond the length of any one presidential term."
