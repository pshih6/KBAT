Lucius Postumius Megellus (c. 345 BC â€“ c. 260 BC) was a politician and general during the middle years of the Roman Republic. Reportedly an arrogant and overbearing man, he was elected consul in 305 BC. The Second Samnite War was ongoing, and as consul he led troops against the Samnites. He defeated them at the Battle of Bovianum and took the town of Bovianum, which caused the Samnites to sue for peace, ending the war. Megellus was awarded a triumph.
Six years later the Third Samnite War broke out. Megellus again served in a senior role, but saw little fighting and after a year his army was disbanded. In 294 he was elected consul for a second time. He led a consular army but was defeated, wounded and driven away. Recovering he led out another army and captured two towns. He then celebrated a second triumph in defiance of the senate's wishes. Only his subsequent participation in the victorious Battle of Aquilonia prevented his prosecution.
Two years later, as the war was drawing to a close, Megellus held the office which oversaw the consular elections. He exploited this to have himself elected consul, in spite of the law requiring a ten year gap. Amidst furious arguments with his fellow consul, one of the previous year's consuls and the senate he carried the Siege of Cominium to a successful conclusion. With the war all but over he returned to Rome demanding a third triumph. This was refused, and when he left office he was tried for malfeasance and given an enormous fine.
