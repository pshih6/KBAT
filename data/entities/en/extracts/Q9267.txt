Turkmen (Türkmençe, Түркменче, تۆرکمنچه‎, [tʏɾkmɛntʃɛ] or türkmen dili, түркмен дили, تۆرکمن ديلی‎, [tʏɾkmɛn dɪlɪ]) is an Oghuz Turkic language spoken by the Turkmens of Central Asia and the official language of Turkmenistan. It has an estimated five million native speakers in Turkmenistan, a further 719,000 speakers in Northeastern Iran, and 1.5 million people in Northwestern Afghanistan.However, many Iranian "Turkmen" are speakers of Khorasani Turkic. Moreover, Iraqi and Syrian "Turkmen" speak dialects that form a continuum between Turkish and Azerbaijani, in both cases heavily influenced by Arabic. These three varieties are not Turkmen in the sense of this article.
