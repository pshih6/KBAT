A chess composer is a person who creates endgame studies or chess problems. Chess composers usually specialize in a particular genre, e.g. endgame studies, twomovers, threemovers, moremovers, helpmates, selfmates, or fairy problems.  Moreover, composers have their own preferred style of composing, allowing their sorting according to composition schools.
Some chess composers produce huge numbers of chess compositions, while others try to achieve as much quality as possible and present new works only rarely.
It is possible for chess composers to gain official FIDE titles, usually for a given number of problems published in FIDE Albums. For example, Milan Vukcevich was an International Grandmaster of Chess Composition, as well as an International Master player.
The PCCC (Permanent Commission for Chess Composition) is a branch of FIDE regulating the awarding of titles such as International Grandmaster, International master, Master FIDE and International Judge for chess composition.
