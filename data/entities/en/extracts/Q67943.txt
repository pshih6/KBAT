Hans Bethge (9 January 1876 â€“ 1 February 1946) was a German poet whose reputation abroad rests above all on the versions of Tang dynasty poetry set in Gustav Mahler's "Das Lied von der Erde". The Max-Eyth-Haus in Kirchheim unter Teck houses a permanent exhibit of Hans Bethge's books, photographs and other artifacts, while his manuscripts are preserved at the Deutsches Literaturarchiv Marbach.
