Johann of Schwarzenberg (December 25, 1463 â€“ October 21, 1528) (also Johann, Freiherr von Schwarzenberg and Hohenlandsberg) was a German moralist and reformer who, as judge of the episcopal court at Bamberg, introduced a new code of evidence which amended the procedure then prevalent in Europe by securing for the accused a more impartial hearing.
