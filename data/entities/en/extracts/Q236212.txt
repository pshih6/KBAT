Petula Clark, CBE (born Sally Olwen Clark, 15 November 1932) is a British singer, actress and composer whose career spans eight decades.
Clark's professional career began during World War II, as an entertainer on BBC Radio. In 1954 she charted with "The Little Shoemaker" — the first of her big UK hits — and within two years began recording in French. International successes included "Prends mon coeur", "Sailor" (a UK number one), "Romeo" and "Chariot". Hits in German, Italian and Spanish followed. In late 1964 Clark's global success extended to America with a four-year run of career-defining, often upbeat singles, many written or co-written by Tony Hatch (and Jackie Trent). These include her signature song "Downtown", "I Know a Place", "My Love", "A Sign of the Times", "I Couldn't Live Without Your Love", "Who Am I", "Colour My World", "This Is My Song" (by Charlie Chaplin), "Don't Sleep in the Subway", "The Other Man's Grass Is Always Greener" and "Kiss Me Goodbye". In America she was dubbed "the First Lady of the British Invasion". She has sold more than 68 million records. She also has enjoyed success in musical films (Finian's Rainbow) and in stage musicals (The Sound of Music, Blood Brothers, Sunset Boulevard).
