The Shining (stylized as Stephen King's The Shining) is a three-episode horror television miniseries based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. Directed by Mick Garris from King's teleplay, it is the second adaptation of King's book after a 1980 film by Stanley Kubrick and was written and produced by King based on his dissatisfaction with Kubrick's version. ABC was quick to offer King the ability to write his script for the adaptation of his book thanks to previous successes with King miniseries such as It (1990), The Tommyknockers (1993), and The Stand (1994), which was also directed by Garris. The miniseries was shot at The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, King's inspiration for the novel, in March 1997.
The 1997 adaptation stars Steven Weber as Jack Torrance; Rebecca De Mornay as Jack's wife Wendy; Courtland Mead and Wil Horneff as different-aged versions of Danny Torrance; and Melvin Van Peebles as Dick Hallorann. Actors such as Pat Hingle, Elliott Gould, John Durbin, Stanley Anderson, Lisa Thornhill, and Garris' wife Cynthia appear in supporting roles; and several notable writers and filmmakers who work in the horror genre also cameo in the miniseries' ballroom scene, King himself appearing as an orchestra conductor.
Originally airing from April 27 to May 1, 1997 on ABC, The Shining enjoyed a favorable reception when it first aired. It was a ratings hit, being in the top 20 of daily viewership numbers for all three episodes; acclaimed by critics for its careful pacing, depth, and creepy atmosphere; and won two Primetime Emmy and two Saturn Awards. However, retrospective critics have viewed the miniseries less fondly, comparing it unfavorably to Kubrick's film version.
