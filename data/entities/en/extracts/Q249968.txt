Arthur Lester Matthews (6 June 1900 â€“ 5 June 1975) was an English actor born in Nottingham. In his career, the handsome Englishman made more than 180 appearances in film and on television. He was erroneously credited in later years as Les Matthews. Matthews played supporting roles in films like The Raven and Werewolf of London (both 1935), but his career deteriorated into bit parts. He died on 5 June 1975, the day before his 75th birthday, in Los Angeles. His ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean.
