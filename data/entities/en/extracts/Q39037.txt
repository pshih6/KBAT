The Fairly OddParents is an American animated television series created by Butch Hartman for Nickelodeon. The series follows the adventures of Timmy Turner, a 10-year-old boy with two fairy godparents named Cosmo and Wanda. He is constantly at odds with his 16-year-old babysitter Vicky, with whom his parents are oblivious to her malevolent doings against their son. It was produced by Frederator Studios (2001–2017), Nickelodeon Animation Studio, and Billionfold Inc. (2008–2017).
The series originated from shorts on Nick's animation showcase, Oh Yeah! Cartoons, that aired from 1998 to 2001. It was later picked up as a half-hour series on March 30, 2001, due to its popularity. Originally, it ended on November 25, 2006, totaling five seasons, but resumed production in 2008. Production of the series ceased again after Hartman left Nickelodeon in February 2018.
