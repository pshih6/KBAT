Manfred Ackermann (born 1 November 1898 in Mikulov (Moravia), died 16 June 1991 in Vienna) was an Austrian Social Democratic politician and trade union official in Austria and the United States.
Ackermann served in the Austrian forces during World War I. After returning to civilian life, he became involved in trade union activities and the Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei (SDAP).
The SDAP was banned in the 1930s and Ackermann was arrested in March 1934, after the Austrian Civil War, and held until summer, 1935 in WÃ¶llersdorf detention camp. He was re-arrested in November 1937 as a result of working illegally and held until Schuschnigg's general amnesty in March 1938.
After the Anschluss of Austria by Germany in 1938, Ackermann was, as a Socialist and a Jew, obliged to flee the Nazis. After passing through Italy, Switzerland and Belgium, he lived in Paris, but in 1939 he was imprisoned by the French in Colombes and Montargis. He was subsequently able to go, via Spain and Portugal, to the United States where he worked and was again active in trades unions.
Ackermann retired in 1964 and returned to Austria. He lectured there until his death in 1991 and was one of the initiators of the Contact Committee of the Federation of Socialist Youth freedom fighters. His urn is held at Feuerhalle Simmering in Vienna.
Manfred Ackermann was married to Paula Popp.
