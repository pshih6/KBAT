Anthony Francis Lucas (born Antun Lučić; September 9, 1855 – September 2, 1921) was an American Croatian-born oil explorer. With Pattillo Higgins he organized the drilling of an oil well near Beaumont, Texas that became known as Spindletop. This led to the widespread exploitation of oil and the start of the petroleum age.
