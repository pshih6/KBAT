Daniel Prenn (7 September 1904 â€“ 3 September 1991) was a Russian-born German, Polish, and British tennis player who was Jewish. He was ranked the World No. 6 for 1932 by A. Wallis Myers, and the European No. 1 by "American Lawn Tennis" magazine. He was ranked world # 8 in 1929 (Bill Tilden), world # 7 in 1934 (American Lawn Tennis), and was ranked # 1 in Germany for the four years from 1928 to 1932. He was a runner-up for the mixed doubles title of Wimbledon in 1930. When the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, they barred him from playing because he was Jewish. He emigrated from Germany to England, and later became a successful businessman.
