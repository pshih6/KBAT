Gregorio Pacheco Leyes (4 July 1823 – 20 August 1899) was the constitutional President of Bolivia from 1884 to 1888. A native of Livilivi, Province of Potosí, Pacheco won a disputed election that was a virtual three-way tie between him, Conservative leader Aniceto Arce, and Liberal chief Eliodoro Camacho. Pacheco was self-made a wealthy man (he was born poor) and the country's foremost philanthropist. He made his money purchasing shares in defunct silver mines which he rehabilitated. By the mid 19th century Pacheco emerged as a wealthy,  efficient, progressive, and pragmatic silver tycoon. Bolivia's state of instability, fraught with coups and international conflicts concerned him greatly.
