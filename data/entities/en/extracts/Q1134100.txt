Victoria of France (French: Victoire de France; 24 June 1556 – 17 August 1556) and her twin sister Joan were the last children born to King Henry II of France and his wife, Catherine de' Medici.
Their mother's confinement came on June 24, 1556. Although Joan died in the womb, Princess Victoria survived the birth—only to die a little more than a month later.
Because their birth very nearly cost their mother her life, the king's physician advised the king that there should be no more children; therefore, Henry II stopped visiting his wife's bedroom and spent all his time with his longtime mistress, Diane de Poitiers.
