John "Iron-Mad" Wilkinson (1728 â€“ 14 July 1808) was an English industrialist who pioneered the manufacture of cast iron and the use of cast-iron goods during the Industrial Revolution. He was the inventor of a precision boring machine that could bore cast iron cylinders, such as cannon barrels  and those used in the steam engines of James Watt. His boring machine has been called the first machine tool.  He also developed a blowing device for blast furnaces that allowed higher temperatures, increasing their efficiency.
