Guillermo Enrique Billinghurst Angulo (Arica, July 27, 1851 – Iquique, June 28, 1915) was a Peruvian politician who served as the 31st President of Peru. He succeeded Augusto B. Leguía, from 1912 to 1914. Billinghurst was of part English descent. The surname Billinghurst is a locational name 'of Billinghurst' a parish in Sussex, England.
During his presidency, Billinghurst became embroiled in an increasingly bitter series of conflicts with Congress, ranging from proposed advanced social legislation to settlement of the Tacna-Arica dispute.
This provoked a military uprising organized by civilian opponents to his regime who used the military to carry out a coup. As a result of the uprising, Billinghurst was sent into exile in Chile where he died shortly thereafter.
