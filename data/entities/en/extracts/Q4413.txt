Alpha Condé (born 4 March 1938) is a Guinean politician who has been President of Guinea since December 2010. He spent decades in opposition to a succession of regimes in Guinea, unsuccessfully running against President Lansana Conté in the 1993 and 1998 presidential elections and leading the Rally of the Guinean People (RPG), an opposition party. Standing again in the 2010 presidential election, Condé was elected as President of Guinea in a second round of voting.  When he took office that December, he became the first freely elected president in the country's history. Condé was reelected in 2015 with almost 58 percent of the vote.Upon his election in 2010, Conde claimed he would strengthen Guinea as a democracy and fight corruption in his country, but he and his son have since been implicated in a number of corruption scandals mostly related to the mining industry, and suspected of election rigging.On 30 January 2017, Condé succeeded Chad's Idriss Deby as head of the African Union.  He was later succeeded by Rwandan President Paul Kagame on 28 January 2018.
