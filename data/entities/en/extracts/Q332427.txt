The Exterminating Angel (Spanish: El ángel exterminador), is a 1962 surrealist film, written and directed by Luis Buñuel, starring Silvia Pinal, and produced by her then-husband Gustavo Alatriste. Sharply satirical and allegorical, the film contains a view of the aristocracy suggesting they "harbor savage instincts and unspeakable secrets".It is considered one of the best 1,000 films by The New York Times, and was adapted into an opera in 2016.
