The Syrian Republic (Arabic: الجمهورية السورية‎ al-Jumhūrīyah as-Sūrīyah; French: République syrienne) was recognized as a sovereign state in 1945 and became de facto independent in April 1946 from the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. In 1958, Syria joined with the Republic of Egypt in forming the United Arab Republic, though Syria withdrew from the union in 1961 and adopted the name Syrian Arab Republic. In 1963, the Syrian Ba'athist Party came to power in a bloody military coup, which laid foundations for the political structure in Syria for the next decades.
