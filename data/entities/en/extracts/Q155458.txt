Staying Alive is a 1983 American dance musical film starring John Travolta as dancer Tony Manero, with Cynthia Rhodes, Finola Hughes, Joyce Hyser, Julie Bovasso, and dancers Viktor Manoel and Kevyn Morrow. It is a sequel to Saturday Night Fever (1977). The film was directed by Sylvester Stallone, who also co-produced and co-wrote the film with the original Saturday Night Fever producer and writer, Robert Stigwood and Norman Wexler, respectively. Along with Homefront, this is one of only two films which Stallone wrote without being the star (although he does have a cameo appearance). The choreography was done by Dennon and Sayhber Rawles.
The title of the film comes from the Bee Gees song of the same name, which was used as the theme song to Saturday Night Fever and is also played during the final scene of Staying Alive. The title also reflects Tony's circumstances at the film's beginning, in which he is barely surviving as he pursues his dream of making his dancing career.
Unlike Saturday Night Fever, Staying Alive was not as critically acclaimed and holds a score of 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. Nonetheless, it was a box office success, earning $65 million on a $22 million budget. It also featured Sylvester Stallone's young brother Frank's big hit "Far from Over", which peaked at #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Cashbox charts.
