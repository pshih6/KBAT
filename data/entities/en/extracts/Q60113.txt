Bernhard Heinrich Karl Martin von Bülow (German: [fɔn ˈbyːlo]; 3 May 1849 – 28 October 1929), created Fürst von Bülow in 1905, was a German statesman who served as Foreign Minister for three years and then as Chancellor of the German Empire from 1900 to 1909. A fervent advocate of Weltpolitik, Bülow single-mindedly devoted his chancellorship to securing his country's recognition as a world power. Despite presiding over sustained economic growth and technological advancement within Germany, his government’s belligerent foreign policy did much to antagonize the international community and significantly contributed to the outbreak of the First World War.
