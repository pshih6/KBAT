James Booth (born David Geeves); (19 December 1927 â€“ 11 August 2005) was an English film, stage and television actor and screenwriter.  Though considered handsome enough to play leading roles, and versatile enough to play a wide variety of character parts, Booth naturally projected a shifty, wolfish, or unpredictable quality that led inevitably to villainous roles and comedy, usually with a cockney flavour. He is probably best known for his role as Private Henry Hook in Zulu.
