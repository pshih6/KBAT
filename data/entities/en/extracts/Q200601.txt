Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (Spanish: Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, PUCP) is a private university in Lima, Peru. It was founded in 1917 with the support and approval of the Catholic Church. The person who dealt the necessary formalities was Catholic priest Father Jorge Dintilhac SS.CC. This University was the Peru's first non-State institution of higher learning. Academically, PUCP ranks alternatively as first or second in Peru.
In July 2012, after an apostolic visitation, begun earlier, in 2011, by Cardinal Peter Erdo, Archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest, Hungary, the Holy See withdrew from the university the right under canon law to use the titles Catholic and Pontifical in its name. Titles like "Catholic" and "Pontifical" are granted by Vatican only after meeting legal requirements.  However, on Monday, 28 April 2014, the Rector of the University stated that,: "The Holy Father, Pope Francis, has formed a Commission of Cardinals with the mission of meeting to find a 'final, consensual solution,' in the framework of the Apostolic Constitution 'Ex Corde Ecclesiae,' ('From the Heart of the Church') to the outstanding issues" between the Vatican and the University." Besides Cardinal Erdo, the other two Cardinal Members of the Commission will be Cardinal Gerald Lacroix, Archbishop of Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, and Cardinal Ricardo Ezzati Andrello, Archbishop of Santiago de Chile, Chile. In 2016, Vatican restored the lost titles and determined that Archbishop of Lima will not assume ever the position of Chancellor of the University. It was a sort of appeasement for rebel authorities because Archbishop of Lima, Juan Luis Cipriani, was the main advocate of the Vatican interests. Nevertheless, nowadays (December 2018) those authorities are facing charges, and Rector Marcial Rubio had to resign after a scandal of undue and abusive charges of students.
