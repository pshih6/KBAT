Lucy Mae Bruner Baxley Smith (December 21, 1937 â€“ October 14, 2016) was an American politician who served from 2003 to 2007 as the 28th Lieutenant Governor of Alabama and from 2009 until 2013 as President of the Alabama Public Service Commission. She was the first woman to hold the state's office of lieutenant governor. In 2006, she was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for governor. In 2008, Lucy Baxley was elected President of the Alabama Public Service Commission, and was the only Democrat to win statewide that year. Until Democrat Doug Jones's victory over Republican Roy Moore in the 2017 U.S. Senate special election, Baxley was the most recent Democrat to hold statewide office in Alabama.
