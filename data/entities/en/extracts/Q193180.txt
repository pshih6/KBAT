Kajaani (Swedish: Kajana) is a town and municipality in Finland. It is the center and capital of the Kainuu region. It is located southeast of Ouluj√§rvi (Lake Oulu), which drains to the Gulf of Bothnia along the Oulujoki (river Oulu). As of 31 January 2019, it had a population of 36,943.The town began in the 17th century, fuelled by the growth of the tar industry. It succumbed to Russian forces during the Greater Wrath of the 18th century, who ruined the Kajaani Castle in 1716. Today, the local economy is driven by mainly the sawmill, lumber and paper industries, although  UPM Kymmene's Kajaani paper mill, the main employer from 1907 until 2008, has now closed. Kajaani Church was built in 1896 in the Neo-Gothic style by architect Jac Ahrenberg, replacing an earlier church. Kajaani Town Theatre was established in 1969.
Kajaani is home to two football clubs, AC Kajaani and Kajaanin Haka, and ice hockey team Hokki. Kajaani University of Applied Sciences was established in 1992.
