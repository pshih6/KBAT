Viktor Hamburger (July 9, 1900 â€“ June 12, 2001) was a German-American professor and embryologist. His collaboration with neuroscientist Rita Levi-Montalcini resulted in the discovery of nerve growth factor. In 1951 he and Howard Hamilton in 1951 published a standardized
stage series to describe chicken embryo development, now called the Hamburger-Hamilton stages.  He was considered "one of the most influential neuroembryologists of the twentieth century".
