Khujand (Tajik: Хуҷанд, romanized: Xujand; Uzbek: Xo‘jand/Хўжанд; Persian: خجند‌‎, romanized: Xojand), sometimes spelled Khodjent and known as Leninabad (Tajik: Ленинобод, romanized: Leninobod; Persian: لنین‌آباد‌‎, romanized: Leninâbâd) from 1936 to 1991, is the second-largest city of Tajikistan and the capital of Tajikistan's northernmost province, Sughd. Khujand is one of the oldest cities in Central Asia, dating back about 2,500 years. Situated on the Syr Darya river at the mouth of the Fergana Valley, Khujand was a major city along the ancient Silk Road.  Captured by Alexander the Great in 329 BCE, it has been part of various empires in history, including the Umayyad Caliphate (8th century), the Mongol Empire (13th century) and the Russian empire (19th century).  Today, the majority of its population are ethnic Tajiks and the city is close to the present borders of both Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.
