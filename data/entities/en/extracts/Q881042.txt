The Seeheimer Kreis (English: "Seeheim Circle") is an official internal grouping in the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). The group describes itself as "undogmatic and pragmatic" and generally takes moderately liberal economic positions.
It was founded in September 1974. One of the prominent founding members is Gesine Schwan, a former SPD candidate for the German Presidency. The group is led by Petra Ernstberger, Carsten Schneider, and Johannes Kahrs. The Circle is named after its long-standing meeting place, Seeheim (Bergstra√üe), just south of Frankfurt.
