Karl-Theodor Molinari (7 February 1915 â€“ 11 December 1993) was an officer in the German Army and later in the Bundeswehr. He resigned in 1970 with the rank of a Generalmajor after it became public that he had possibly been involved in the shooting of 105 French resistance fighters in the Ardennes area on 12/13 June 1944. These allegations have not been proven since. Besides, Molinari was a politician, representative of the German Christian Democratic Union in the afterwar years.
