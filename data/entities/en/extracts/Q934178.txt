Declan Hill is a journalist, academic and consultant. He is one of the world’s foremost experts on match-fixing and corruption in international sports. In 2008, Hill, as a Chevening Scholar, obtained his doctorate in Sociology at the University of Oxford. Currently, he is a senior research fellow in anti-corruption in sports at the University of Würzburg and a professor at the University of New Haven.His book ‘The Fix: Organized Crime and Soccer’ has appeared in twenty-one languages. Hill was the first person to show the new danger to international sport posed by the globalization of the gambling market and match-fixing at the highest levels of professional football (soccer) including the Champions League and FIFA World Cup tournaments. Part of the book details his involvement with an Asian match-fixing gang as they travelled around the world to fix major football matches. Hill has also published a number of academic articles, is a reviewer for Global Integrity and has probed the impact of the Russian mafia on professional ice hockey. In 2011, he pioneered the first on-line anti-match-fixing education course for Sport Accord that was eventually used by Interpol.
In 2013, his second book 'The Insider's Guide to Match-Fixing' was published and immediately translated to Japanese. It is a popular version of his doctoral thesis and was dubbed by its English-language publisher as 'Freakonomics meets Sports Corruption'
