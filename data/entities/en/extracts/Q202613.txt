MU330 are an American ska punk band from St. Louis, Missouri, United States.
Formed by students of St. Louis University High School in 1988, MU330 played a self-described brand of music called "Psycho Ska", high energy ska punk marked by manic performances and humorous, often strange lyricism. Since 1997, however, the band's musical direction has shifted towards a more melodic and lyric-driven ska/indie rock sound, a combination that's been described as "Weezer meets The Specials".Dan Potthast (guitar/vocals), Ted Moll (drums), Chris Diebold (bass) and Robert Bell (trombone) have remained with MU330 since the band's inception, while trombonist Gerry Lundquist has been a member for over a decade. Though several different frontmen have been featured in the past, Potthast has always acted as the band's principal songwriter and lyricist.
