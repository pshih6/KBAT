Thomas Naogeorgus (Thomas Kirchmeyer, Kirchmair, Neubauer; 21 December 1508 â€“ 29 December 1563) was a Latin dramatist, humanist, Protestant theologian, Protestant reformer, preacher and pamphleteer of the German Renaissance.
Naogeorgus was born in Straubing.  His dramatic works were very influential in the German Reformation. He was greatly influenced by Martin Luther, but his teachings stand independent of Lutheranism, and the publication of his exegesis of 1 John was opposed by Luther and Melanchthon.  He died, aged 55, in Wiesloch.
