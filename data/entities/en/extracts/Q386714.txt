Count Dracula (German: Nachts, wenn Dracula erwacht, lit. 'At night, when Dracula awakens') is a 1969 Spanish-Italian-German-British horror film (released in 1970), directed by Jes√∫s Franco and starring Christopher Lee, Herbert Lom and Klaus Kinski. It was based on the novel Dracula by Bram Stoker.
Although Count Dracula stars Christopher Lee in the title role, it is not a Hammer production like his other Dracula films, being produced instead by Harry Alan Towers. Klaus Kinski, who would play Dracula himself nine years later in Nosferatu the Vampyre, is also featured in the film as Renfield. Count Dracula was advertised as the most faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel. Among other details, it was the first film version of the novel in which Dracula begins as an old man and becomes younger as he feeds upon fresh blood.
The film was shot at the Tirrenia Studios and on location in Spain. The film's sets were designed by the art director Karl Schneider.
