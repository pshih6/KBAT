Friedrich Samuel Bock (Königsberg 20 May 1716 – Königsberg 30 September 1785) was a German philosopher and theologian.In 1753 he was appointed first professor of Greek, then theology at the University of Königsberg, though he resigned both positions in 1770 due to the University's failure to pay a salary, plus the onerous duty that the professor of Greek had to lecture on the whole of the New Testament annually.
He retained his previous position as university librarian, in all for twenty-seven years. It was in this position that Bock is associated with Immanuel Kant who was his assistant. At this period the library, or Schloßbibliothek, was situated in two rooms in the castle.
