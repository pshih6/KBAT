Eureka is a 1983 British-American drama film directed by Nicolas Roeg. It is the story of a Klondike prospector, Jack McCann (Gene Hackman) who strikes it rich, yet ends up fearing that his daughter Tracy (Theresa Russell) and his son-in-law (Rutger Hauer) are scheming to take his wealth and his soul; moreover, greedy investors (Joe Pesci and Mickey Rourke) are also hunting McCann's fortune.
Eureka is loosely based on the true murder of Sir Harry Oakes in the Bahamas in 1943.
