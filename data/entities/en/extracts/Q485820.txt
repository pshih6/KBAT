Blur are an English rock band formed in London in 1988. The group consists of vocalist Damon Albarn, guitarist Graham Coxon, bassist Alex James, and drummer Dave Rowntree. 
Blur's debut album Leisure (1991) incorporated the sounds of Madchester and shoegazing. Following a stylistic change influenced by English guitar pop groups such as the Kinks, the Beatles, and XTC, Blur released Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994), and The Great Escape (1995). Blur were central to the 1990s Britpop movement; they achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a chart battle with rivals Oasis in 1995 dubbed the "Battle of Britpop".
Blur's self-titled fifth album (1997) incorporated influences from the lo-fi styles of American indie rock groups, and became their third UK chart-topping album. Its single "Song 2" brought Blur mainstream success in the US. Their next album, 13 (1999) saw the band experimenting with electronic and gospel music, and featured more personal lyrics from Albarn. Their seventh album, Think Tank (2003), was shaped by Albarn's growing interest in hip hop and African music, with more minimal guitar work. Coxon left during the recording, and Blur disbanded for several years after the album's release, with the members engaged in other projects.
In 2009, Blur, with Coxon, reunited for a series of concerts. In the following years, they released several singles and compilations and toured internationally. In 2012, they received a Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. Their eighth album, The Magic Whip (2015), was the sixth consecutive Blur studio album to top the British charts.
