William Brooke Joyce (24 April 1906 â€“ 3 January 1946), nicknamed Lord Haw-Haw, was an American-born Fascist politician and Nazi propaganda broadcaster to the United Kingdom during World War II. He took German citizenship in 1940. Joyce was convicted of one count of high treason in 1945 and sentenced to death, with the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords both upholding his conviction. He was hanged on 3 January 1946, making him the last person to be executed for treason in the United Kingdom. Theodore Schurch was hanged the following day, but for the crime of treachery rather than treason.
