Martin Leo Arons (15 February 1860 â€“ 10 October 1919) was a German physicist and social democratic politician. He was the namesake of the Lex Arons, a law which disallowed members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (German: Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands, SPD) to teach at Prussian universities.
