André Cayatte (3 February 1909, in Carcassonne – 6 February 1989, in Paris) was a French filmmaker and lawyer, who became known for his films centering on themes of crime, justice, and moral responsibility.
Cayatte began his directoral career at the German-controlled Continental Films during the French occupation.  Some of Cayatte's earlier films that addressed his characteristic themes include Justice est faite (Justice is Done; 1950), Nous sommes tous des assassins (We Are All Murderers; 1952), and Le passage du Rhin (Tomorrow Is My Turn; 1960).
In 1963, he undertook a bold experiment in film narrative with a set of two films: Jean-Marc ou La vie conjugale (Anatomy of a Marriage: My Days with Jean-Marc) and Françoise ou La vie conjugale (Anatomy of a Marriage: My Days with Françoise). These two films tell the same story from two different points of view. His 1973 film, Il n'y a pas de fumée sans feu, won the Silver Bear Special Jury Prize at the 23rd Berlin International Film Festival.
