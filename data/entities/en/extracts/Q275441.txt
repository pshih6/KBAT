The Labour Party (Dutch: Partij van de Arbeid, [pɑrˈtɛi vɑn də ˈʔɑrbɛit], abbreviated as PvdA, [ˌpeːveːdeːˈjaː, -deːˈʔaː] or P van de A, [ˌpeː vɑn də ˈʔaː]) is a social-democratic political party in the Netherlands.
The party was founded in 1946 as a merger of the Social Democratic Workers' Party, the Free-thinking Democratic League, and the Christian Democratic Union. Prime Ministers from the Labour Party have been Willem Drees (1948–1958), Joop den Uyl (1973–1977), and Wim Kok (1994–2002).
From 2012 to 2017, the PvdA formed the second largest parliamental faction and was the junior partner in the Second Rutte cabinet with the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy. Since 2016, Lodewijk Asscher has been Leader of the Labour Party. The party fell to only nine seats in the House of Representatives at the 2017 general election, making it only the seventh-largest faction in the chamber–its worst showing ever. However, the PvdA rebounded with a first-place finish in the 2019 European Parliament election in the Netherlands, winning 6 of 26 seats with 19% of the vote.
The Labour Party is a member of the European Party of European Socialists and the global Progressive Alliance. In the European Parliament, where the Labour Party has 6 seats, it is part of the parliamentary group Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats.
