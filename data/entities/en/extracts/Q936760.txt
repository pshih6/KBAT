George Mihail Pruteanu (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈd͡ʒe̯ord͡ʒe pruˈte̯anu]; 15 December 1947 – 27 March 2008) was a Romanian literary critic and politician.
His father, Pincu Solomonovici,, was a  Jewish medical doctor and a university professor who researched and organised  the history of Moldavian medicine. His mother, Sofia Pruteanu, was an office worker.  When he was 4 years old his parents divorced and he took his mother maiden name. Born in Bucharest, George Pruteanu studied literature at the Universities of Iaşi and Bucharest and, starting in 1972, he wrote various columns for literary magazines such as Convorbiri Literare, Contemporanul, and Cronica.
After the 1989 Revolution, he continued his work as journalist for newspapers such as Expres and Evenimentul Zilei.
Between 1995 and 1999, he was also the host of a 5-minute daily TV programme on correct usage of the Romanian language ("Doar o vorbă săţ-i mai spun", a title containing a deliberate, provocative mistake), which was broadcast first by Tele 7 ABC (1995), then ProTV (1995–1996), TVR1 (1997–1999) and again TVR1 (2006-2008).
In 1996, he was elected to the Romanian Senate as a Constanţa County Senator on a National Peasants' Party ticket, but resigned in 1998 and in 2000 he was elected once again, this time in Bistriţa-Năsăud County as a member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD). In 2003, he resigned from PSD and joined the Greater Romania Party, running for the Senate in Suceava County in 2004.
Pruteanu introduced a  bill in 1997, which became known as the "Pruteanu Bill", requiring all public notices (including ads) in foreign languages to have Romanian translations. A trimmed-down version of this bill was promulgated by President Ion Iliescu in 2004.
Pruteanu was also critical of the Romanian entertainment industry, especially of low-quality TV programmes and manele, which he calls "intellectual manure".
He died after suffering a heart attack on 27 March 2008.
