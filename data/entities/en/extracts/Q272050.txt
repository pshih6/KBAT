Noname Jane is an American pornographic actress. In the majority of the pornographic films in which she appeared, she used the stage name Violet Blue. In October 2007, a lawsuit brought by the author of the same name charged that Jane had adopted the author's name and persona, prompting Jane to change her stage name to Violetta Blue, and then to Noname Jane, in response to an injunction in the case.
