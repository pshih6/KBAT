Franz-Otto Krüger (April 1, 1917 – March 17, 1988) was a German film and television actor. Krüger already started his acting at Berlin theatres in 1934, but his career was interrupted by his service in the Second World War. He appeared in over 125 film and television productions between 1947 and 1987, mostly in supporting roles. One of his first films was Roberto Rossellini's neorealist classic Germany, Year Zero. 
In addition to acting, he also worked as a stage and television director in his later career. He was also employed as a voice actor and director of German dubbings. Krüger directed the German synchronisation versions of film classics like On the Waterfront, Bambi and The Great Dictator.
