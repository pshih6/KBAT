Sir James Paget, 1st Baronet FRS HFRSE (11 January 1814 – 30 December 1899) (, rhymes with "gadget") was an English surgeon and pathologist who is best remembered for naming Paget's disease and who is considered, together with Rudolf Virchow, as one of the founders of scientific medical pathology. His famous works included Lectures on Tumours (1851) and Lectures on Surgical Pathology (1853). There are several medical conditions which were described and later named after Paget:

Paget's disease of bone
Paget's disease of the nipple (a form of intraductal breast cancer spreading into the skin around the nipple)
Extramammary Paget's disease refers to a group of similar, more rare skin lesions discovered by Radcliffe Crocker in 1889 which affect the male and female genitalia.
Paget–Schroetter disease
Paget's abscess, an abscess that recurs at the site of a former abscess which had resolved.
