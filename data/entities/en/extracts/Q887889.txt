Robert Kenneth Dornan (born April 3, 1933) is an American politician who is a former Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from California.
A boisterous former actor and television and radio talk show host, Dornan had a flair for the dramatic that drew supporters and detractors well beyond his congressional district. Though never a major power in Washington, he became one of the most well-known members of the House of Representatives as a participant in televised "special orders" speeches and has been described as "one of the leading firebrands among American politicians."
