Guy Tillim (born 1962) is a South African photographer known for his work focusing on troubled regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. His photographs and projects have been exhibited internationally and form the basis of several of Tillim's published books.
A member of the country's white minority, Tillim was born in Johannesburg in 1962. He first became professionally involved in photography as a photojournalist in 1986, working with the Afrapix collective, a group of South African documentary photographers providing a unique conduit of photography to world media during apartheid. During much of this time he worked as a freelance photographer for both local and foreign media, including Reuters (1986 to 1988) and Agence France Press (1993 to 1994).The website African Success has described him as one of South Africa's "foremost photographers", whilst the Daily Maverick site has referred to him as "arguably SA's finest photographer" after David Goldblatt.
