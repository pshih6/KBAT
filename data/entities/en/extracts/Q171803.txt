La Blue Girl (淫獣学園 La☆Blue Girl, Injū Gakuen La Blue Girl, roughly "Lewd Beast Academy: La Blue Girl") is an erotic anime and manga series by Toshio Maeda. Like Maeda's other hentai series (e.g., Urotsukidōji), La Blue Girl features a large amount of tentacle rape. It departs somewhat from its predecessors, however, by lightening the atmosphere with humor, lightly parodying the "tentacle hentai" genre.
An immensely successful series, La Blue Girl has inspired, over the years, several OVA series for a total of 14 episodes, a comic book adaptation, three live-action movies, some PC games and some art-books.
