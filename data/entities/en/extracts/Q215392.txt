Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (OSE: NAS), trading as Norwegian, is a Norwegian low-cost airline and Norway's largest airline. It is the third largest low-cost carrier in Europe behind easyJet and Ryanair and the ninth-largest low-cost airline in the world, the largest airline in Scandinavia, and the eighth-largest airline in Europe in terms of passenger numbers. It offers a high-frequency domestic flight schedule within Scandinavia and Finland, and to business destinations such as London, as well as to holiday destinations in the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands, transporting over 30 million people in 2016. The airline is known for its distinctive livery of white with a red nose, with portraits of high achievers on the tail fins of its aircraft.
Norwegian's flights are operated by itself as well as fully owned subsidiaries, including Irish-based Norwegian Air International, UK-based Norwegian Air UK, Swedish-based Norwegian Air Sweden, and Norway-based Norwegian Long Haul. Each airline holds a unique air operator's certificate (AOC) but shares branding and commercial functions with the rest of the Group. Until December 2019, Norwegian also owned and operated Argentina-based Norwegian Air Argentina, which operated domestic flights within the country.
