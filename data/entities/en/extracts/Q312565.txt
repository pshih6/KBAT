The Night Porter (Italian: Il portiere di notte) is a 1974 Italian erotic psychological drama film.  Directed and co-written by Liliana Cavani, the film stars Dirk Bogarde and Charlotte Rampling, and features Philippe Leroy and Gabriele Ferzetti. Its themes of sexual and sadomasochistic obsession have made the film controversial since its initial release, dividing critics over its artistic value.
The Night Porter is widely considered to be a Nazisploitation film and a cult classic. In July 2018, it was selected to be screened in the Venice Classics section at the 75th Venice International Film Festival.
