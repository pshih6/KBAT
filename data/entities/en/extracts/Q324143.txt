Pietro Martellanza (30 September 1938 â€“ 1 February 2010), best known as Peter Martell, was an Italian film actor who had numerous bigger roles in Spaghetti westerns. Sometimes he was credited as Pete Martell or Peter Martel.
Born in Bolzano, he started his career in cinema as a stuntman. He was mainly active in the 1960s and 1970s, appearing in about 70 films. After a longer break he starred in some movies again from 2002 on.
Martell was chosen as the leading actor in God Forgives... I Don't!, but the day before the first shoot he broke his foot during a fight with his girlfriend and was replaced by Terence Hill, which started Hill's successful partnership with Bud Spencer.
