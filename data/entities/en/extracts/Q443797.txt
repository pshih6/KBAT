Joan Maud Littlewood (6 October 1914 â€“ 20 September 2002) was an English theatre director who trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, and is best known for her work in developing the Theatre Workshop. She has been called "The Mother of Modern Theatre". Her production of Oh, What a Lovely War! in 1963 was one of her more influential pieces.
Littlewood and her company lived and slept in the Theatre Royal while it was restored.  Productions of The Alchemist and Richard II, the latter starring Harry H. Corbett in the title role, established the reputation of the company.She also conceived and developed the concept of the Fun Palace in collaboration with architect Cedric Price, an experimental model of a participatory social environment that, although never realized, has become an important influence in the architecture of the 20th and 21st centuries.Miss Littlewood, a musical written about Littlewood by Sam Kenyon, was performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2018.
