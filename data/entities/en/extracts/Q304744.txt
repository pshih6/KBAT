Genaro García Luna (born July 10, 1968, in Mexico City) is a former Mexican government employee and engineer. He served as Secretary of Public Security in the federal cabinet.
After his term working for the Mexican government, Genaro works as a consultant and businessman evaluating the social, political and financial economics in Mexico and Latin America. He is a partner in the company GLAC which provides an index to evaluate risk and security conditions. The GLAC index is also published in El Heraldo De Mexico, and  El Financiero and is used by the business community to evaluate the risk and security conditions for different states and cities in Mexico.García Luna was included in a list of the "10 most corrupt Mexicans" published by Forbes in 2013. He broke a self-imposed silence in a letter to Steve Forbes that his inclusion in the list was based on lies and that it lacked journalistic integrity.
He is the author of Contra el crimen: ¿Por qué 1,661 corporaciones de policía no bastan? Pasado, Presente y Futuro de la Policía en México (2006) [Against Crime: Why 1,661 police forces are not enough. Past, Present and Future of Police in Mexico], where he first laid out the basic concepts of the New Police Model for Mexico, placing the emphasis on the importance of intelligence tasks, and “El Nuevo Modelo de Seguridad para México” (2011), which indicates what are the considerations and the state vision to confront a national priority.
In the 2018 trial of the drug kingpin Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán Loera, El Chapo's partner Ismael Zambada García’s brother, Jesus Zambada García, testified to bribing García Luna with suitcases stuffed with $3 million in cash on two occasions. On December 9, 2019, García Luna was arrested in Dallas on charges of taking millions in bribes from the Sinaloa cartel.
