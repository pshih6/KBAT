Sir Gawaine George Hope Baillie, 7th Baronet (8 March 1934 â€“ 21 December 2003) was a British amateur motor racing driver, engineer, industrialist, stamp collector, and the owner of the estate surrounding Leeds Castle, the ancient fortress in Kent. The castle itself was bequeathed to the nation upon his mother's death in 1974. After his death, it was discovered that he had amassed, almost entirely in secret, one of the greatest collections of stamps of the former British Empire.
