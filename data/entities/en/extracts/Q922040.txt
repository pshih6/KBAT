Wenceslau José de Sousa de Moraes (30 May 1854, in Lisbon – 1 July 1929, in Tokushima), in modern orthography Venceslau de Morais, was a Portuguese writer whose works were steeped in orientalism and exoticism, particularly the culture of Japan. He has been compared to Lafcadio Hearn, a contemporary who settled in Japan but wrote in English. A translator of Haiku, his verse was also influenced by Symbolism.
