Johannes Baptista Fallati (15 March 1809 – 5 October 1855) was a German  statistician and economist. He was born at Hamburg, where his father, originally of Rovigo (Venetia),  was a merchant.
Fallati was educated at Tübingen and Heidelberg, and in 1838 became professor  of political history and statistics at the former university. In 1839 he travelled to England,  inquiring into English statistical societies and  other institutions. In 1848 he became a  member of the Württemberg parliament, and  under-secretary for commerce in the short-lived Frankfurt imperial assembly, 1848–49. On  its dissolution he returned to an academic  career, becoming in 1850 university librarian at Tübingen.
From 1844 till his death, Fallati was joint-editor of the quarterly Zeitschrift fur die gesammte Staatswissenschaft.  During his brief political career he planned  and embodied legislative organisation in four  directions, viz. the imperial consulate, inland navigation, marine measurement, and his most cherished idea an imperial statistical bureau.  He also prosecuted inquiry in the question of  emigration. To a winning personality and many-sided culture he united clear and practical method.
He died of cholera in The Hague.
