Yosef (Joseph) "Tommy" Lapid (Hebrew: יוסף "טומי" לפיד, born as Tomislav Lampel (Serbian Cyrillic: Томислав Лампел); 27 December 1931 – 1 June 2008) was a Serbian-born Israeli radio and television presenter, playwright, journalist, politician and government minister known for his sharp tongue and acerbic wit. Lapid headed the secular-liberal Shinui party from 1999 to 2006. He fiercely opposed the ultra-Orthodox political parties and actively sought to exclude any religious observance from the legal structure of the Israeli State.
