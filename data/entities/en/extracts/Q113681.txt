Israel Zangwill (21 January 1864 â€“ 1 August 1926) was a British author at the forefront of cultural Zionism during the 19th century, and was a close associate of Theodor Herzl.  He later rejected the search for a Jewish homeland in Palestine and became the prime thinker behind the territorial movement.
