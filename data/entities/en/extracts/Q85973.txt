Iancu Flondor (3 August 1865, Storozhynets – 19 October 1924) was a Romanian politician who advocated Bukovina's union with the Kingdom of Romania. 
He was born in the town of Storozhynets (Romanian: Storojineṭ) in Northern Bukovina (now in Ukraine). His parents were Gheorghe Flondor (1828–1892) and Isabella von Dobrowolski-Buchenthal (1835–1890).  Married to Elena de Zotta, he fathered three sons: Şerban (1900–1971), Neagoe (1901–1952), and Mircea (1908–1928).During the winter of 1918, Flondor clashed with his rival Aurel Onciul over the political future of Bukovina, a dispute which culminated in the November request by the National Council of Bukovina, headed by Flondor, for an intervention by the Romanian Army into what had become a chaotic Bukovina. Under those circumstances, the Romanian government in Iaşi, wishing to protect the population, decided to send to Bukovina the 8th Division under the command of General Iacob Zadik, who entered Cernăuţi, on 9 November 1918. On 12 November, the National Council of Bukovina effectively took the helm of Bukovina, forming a cabinet headed by Iancu Flondor. On 15/28 November 1918, the debates of General Congress of Bukovina opened at the Metropolitan Palace in Cernăuţi and decided : "The unconditional and eternal union of Bukovina -within its old boundaries  up to the rivers Ceremuş,  Colacin and Dniester – to the  kingdom of Romania".
He died in Cernăuṭi (now Chernivtsi), and was buried in Storojineṭ.
