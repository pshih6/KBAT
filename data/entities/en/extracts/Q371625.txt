New York City's first public coeducational liberal arts college, it has been nicknamed, more recently, "the poor man's Harvard."In 1930, Brooklyn College formed by the merger of the Brooklyn branches of Hunter College, then a women's college, and of the City College of New York, then a men's college, both established in 1926. Initially tuition-free, but suffering in New York City government's near bankrupt in 1975, Brooklyn College then closed its campus in downtown Brooklyn.
In 1976, with its Midwood campus intact, and newly Brooklyn College's only campus, the college charged tuition for the first time. The college maintained its high national ranking in numbers of doctoral alumni.
