Jeanne Françoise Julie Adélaïde Récamier (French pronunciation: ​[ʒan fʁɑ̃swaz ʒyli adela.id ʁekamje]; 3 December 1777 – 11 May 1849), known as Juliette (French pronunciation: ​[ʒyljɛt]), was a French socialite, whose salon drew Parisians from the leading literary and political circles of the early 19th century. As an icon of neoclassicism, Récamier cultivated a public persona of herself as a great beauty and her fame quickly spread across Europe. She befriended many intellectuals, sat for the finest artists of the age, and spurned an offer of marriage from Prince Augustus of Prussia.
