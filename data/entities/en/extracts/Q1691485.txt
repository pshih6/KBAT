Joe Kayser (September 14, 1891, St. Louis - October 3, 1981, Evanston, Illinois) was an American dance bandleader.
In 1917, Kayser relocated to New York City to join Earl Fuller's band, which played at a restaurant called Rector's. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War I, forming a band which included Benny Kubelsky on violin. Following the war, the Meyer Davis Organization hired him to lead a dance band which played in North and South Carolina. In 1921, he returned to his home town of St. Louis, where he put together his own group, which started as a five-piece but which eventually grew to the size of an orchestra. Among his sidemen were Gene Krupa, David Rose, Muggsy Spanier, Jess Stacy, and Frankie Trumbauer. The group became a popular territory band in the Midwest, and eventually moved to Chicago, where it played at the Trianon Ballroom and the Aragon Ballroom.
Starting in 1929, Kayser began taking positions as musical director of theater orchestras - first the Diversey Theater, in Chicago, and then the Midland Theater, in Kansas City. He continued to tour with his orchestra while holding these positions. He played at the 1933 World's Fair, accompanying Sally Rand. He dissolved the band in 1936 to work for NBC, and then became an executive for MCA in 1943, remaining there until his retirement in 1955.
