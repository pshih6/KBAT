Mahammad bin Suleyman (Classical Azerbaijani: محمد سليمان اوغلی‎ Məhəmməd Süleyman oğlu), better known by his pen name Fuzuli (Azerbaijani: فضولی‎ Füzuli; c. 1494 – 1556), was an Azerbaijani, of the Bayat tribes of Oghuz, poet, writer and thinker. Often considered one of the greatest contributors to the divan tradition of Azerbaijani literature, Fuzuli in fact wrote his collected poems (divan) in three different languages: in his native Azerbaijani, Arabic and Persian. He was well-versed in both the Ottoman and Chagatai Turkic literary traditions as well as mathematics and astronomy.
