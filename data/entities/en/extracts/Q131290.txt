Ganja (; Azerbaijani: Gəncə [ɟænˈd͡ʒæ]; Persian: گنجه‎) is Azerbaijan's second largest city, with a population of around 332,600. It was named Elisabethpol (Russian: Елизаветпо́ль, tr. Yelizavetpól', IPA: [jɪlʲɪzəvʲɪtˈpolʲ]) in the Russian Empire period. The city regained its original name, Ganja, in 1920 during the first part of its incorporation into the Soviet Union. However, its name was changed again in 1935 to Kirovabad (Russian: Кироваба́д, IPA: [kʲɪrəvɐˈbat]) and retained that name through most of the rest of the Soviet period. In 1989, during perestroika, the city regained its original name.
