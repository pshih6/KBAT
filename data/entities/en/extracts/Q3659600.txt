The engine went into production at Marquis Michele Carcano di Anzano del Parcos factory, using a leather strap as transmission. Carlo was engaged as a racer of these bicycles, winning the Brescia-Orzinouvi (1899), Brescia-Cremona-Mantua-Verona-Brescia and Padova-Bovolenta (1900).Carcanos factory ended in 1901, and Carlo worked as test driver for Fiat (1901–1903), then as test driver and mechanic at Isotta Fraschini (1903) where he was joined by brother Alfieri Maserati. He moved to work on automobiles for Bianchi (motorcycles) (1907), where he raced the Coppa Florio (9th) and the Kaiserpreis, before becoming manager of the Junior car company (1908). At Junior, he hired his brother Ettore Maserati. Carlo died of tuberculosis (1910) and his brothers established Maserati in Bologna (1914).
