Hoyerswerda (German: [hɔʏɐsˈvɛʁda]; Upper Sorbian: Wojerecy, [ˈβɔjɛʀɛtsɪ] (listen)) is a major district town in the district of Bautzen in the German state of Saxony. It is located in the Sorbian settlement area of Upper Lusatia, a region where some people speak the Sorbian language in addition to German.
Hoyerswerda is divided into the Old Town and the New Town surrounded by village areas. The Old Town is the historical centre with a lot of old houses and many sight-seeing attractions, the New Town is more modern and varicoloured. Prior to the renovation of the town, prefabricated apartment blocks predominated in this area.
The town has many lakes, marshes and waterways in its surrounding area, because of its situation in Lusatia. This brings many tourists to spend their holidays there. The place is also very attractive for cyclists and inline skaters who use recently created paths meandering among the lakes.
