In Islam, the ulama (; Arabic: علماء‎ ʿUlamāʾ, singular عالِم ʿĀlim, "scholar", literally "the learned ones", also spelled ulema; feminine: alimah [singular] and uluma [plural]) are the guardians, transmitters and interpreters of religious knowledge in Islam, including Islamic doctrine and law.By longstanding tradition, ulama are educated in religious institutions (madrasas). The Quran and sunnah (authentic hadith), are the scriptural sources of traditional Islamic law.
