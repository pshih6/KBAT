Danie Gerhardus Krige Afrikaans pronunciation: [dɑniː ˈkriχə] (26 August 1919 – 3 March 2013) was a South African statistician and mining engineer who pioneered the field of geostatistics and was professor at the University of the Witwatersrand, Republic of South Africa. The technique of kriging is named after him. Krige's empirical work to evaluate mineral resources was formalised in the 1960s by French engineer Georges Matheron.
