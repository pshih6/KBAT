Sword-and-sandal, also known as peplum (pepla plural), is a subgenre of largely Italian-made historical or Biblical epics mostly set in the Greco-Roman or medieval period. These films attempted to emulate the big-budget Hollywood historical epics of the time, such as Spartacus, Samson and Delilah and The Ten Commandments.  These films dominated the Italian film industry from 1958 to 1965, eventually being replaced in 1965 by the spaghetti Western and Eurospy films.The term "peplum" (a Latin word referring to the Ancient Greek garment peplos), was introduced by French film critics in the 1960s. The terms "peplum" and "sword-and-sandal" were used in a condescending way by film critics. Later, the terms were embraced by fans of the films, similar to the terms "spaghetti Western" or "shoot-'em-ups". In their English versions, peplum films can be immediately differentiated from their Hollywood counterparts by their use of "clumsy and inadequate" English language dubbing. A 100-minute documentary on the history of Italy's peplum genre was produced and directed by Antonio Avati in 1977 entitled Kolossal: i magnifici Maciste (aka Kino Kolossal).Italian epic films set in antiquity that were produced before the 1958 peplum wave proper, such as Fabiola (1949) and Ulysses (1954), have been called proto-peplum. and recent films set in such Greco-Roman times (made after the peplum wave ended in 1965) have been called neo-peplum.
