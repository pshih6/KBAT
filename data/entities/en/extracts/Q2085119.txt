Nothing Records was an American record label specializing in industrial rock and electronic music, founded by John Malm Jr. and Trent Reznor in 1992. It is considered an example of a vanity label, where an artist is able to run a label with some degree of independence from within a larger parent company, in this case being Interscope Records.
Nothing Records went largely defunct in 2004 after a lawsuit by Reznor against John Malm. The label became inactive as a whole following several further releases; the 2007 Beside You in Time video was the label's final release.
