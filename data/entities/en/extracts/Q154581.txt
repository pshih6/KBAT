Gangs of New York is a 2002 American epic historical crime film directed by Martin Scorsese, set in the New York slums, and inspired by Herbert Asbury's non-fiction book The Gangs of New York. The screenplay was written by Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian, and Kenneth Lonergan. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz.
In 1863, a long-running Catholic–Protestant feud erupts into violence, just as an Irish immigrant group is protesting about low wages caused by an influx of freed slaves, as well as the threat of conscription. Scorsese spent twenty years developing the project until in 1999 Harvey Weinstein and his production company Miramax Films acquired it. Made in Cinecittà, Rome and in New York, the film was completed by 2001, but its release was delayed following the September 11 attacks. Released on December 20, 2002, the film grossed $193 million worldwide against its $100 million budget and received positive reviews from critics for Day-Lewis' performance, Scorsese's directing, the production design and costume design. It was nominated for ten Oscars at the 75th Academy Awards.
