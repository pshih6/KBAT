Kathleen Ann Kelly (born 6 March 1963) is a singer, songwriter, and producer. Born in Leominster, Massachusetts, United States, she is the third child of the musical family group The Kelly Family,  a multi-generational pop group that achieved success in Europe in the 1990s.
In 1999, Kathy released her first solo album titled The Best Of Kathy Kelly which, in addition to her best songs from the albums of The Kelly Family (see The Kelly Family discography), contained five new songs. While still recording and touring with the group throughout the 2000s, Kathy worked on her solo projects, which resulted in three more LPs up to date and a number of singles. Some of the songs included were new versions of the traditional songs from all over the world previously sung by the group from as early as the 1970s; notably "Amazing Grace", "Motherless child", "Old Black Joe", "The Rose of Tralee".
