Gunta Stölzl (5 March 1897 – 22 April 1983) was a German textile artist who played a fundamental role in the development of the Bauhaus school's weaving workshop.  As the Bauhaus' only female master she created enormous change within the weaving department as it transitioned from individual pictorial works to modern industrial designs.  Her textile work is thought to typify the distinctive style of Bauhaus textiles.  She joined the Bauhaus as a student in 1920, became a junior master in 1927 and a full master the next year.  She was dismissed for political reasons in 1931, two years before the Bauhaus closed under pressure from the Nazis.
The textile department was a neglected part of the Bauhaus when Stölzl began her career, and its active masters were weak on the technical aspects of textile production.  She soon became a mentor to other students and reopened the Bauhaus dye studios in 1921.  After a brief departure, Stölzl became the school's weaving director in 1925 when it relocated from Weimar to Dessau and expanded the department to increase its weaving and dyeing facilities.  She applied ideas from modern art to weaving, experimented with synthetic materials, and improved the department's technical instruction to include courses in mathematics.  The Bauhaus weaving workshop became one of its most successful facilities under her direction.
