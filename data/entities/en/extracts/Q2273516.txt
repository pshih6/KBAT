Amaru Entertainment was a record label founded by Afeni Shakur in early 1997 to handle the release of the unreleased material her son had created before his death on September 13, 1996. After the death of 2Pac, the label inherited the rights to 2Pacalypse Now, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z, Thug Life Vol. 1, and Me Against the World. Initially the company distributed their releases through Jive Records beginning with R U Still Down? (Remember Me), and as of 2011, the releases are being distributed by Universal Music Group's Interscope Records. Amaru has also released 11 posthumous albums by 2Pac and a documentary, Tupac: Resurrection. On May 2, 2016, Afeni Shakur died of a heart attack.
