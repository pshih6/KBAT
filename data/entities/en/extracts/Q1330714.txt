Elisha Vanslyck Cook Jr. (December 26, 1903 â€“ May 18, 1995) was an American stage, film and television character actor who often specialized in roles as "cowardly villains and neurotics".  He is perhaps best remembered for his portrayal of Wilmer in the 1941 version of The Maltese Falcon and the futile efforts made by his character to intimidate Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) in the film.  Cook's acting career spanned more than 60 years, with roles in productions including The Big Sleep, Shane, The Killing, House on Haunted Hill, and Rosemary's Baby.
