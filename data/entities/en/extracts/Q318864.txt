KÃ¶hler, is based on Edgar Allan Poe's 1842 short story The Pit and the Pendulum and concerns the saga of Count Regula (Lee) who, after being drawn and quartered for murdering 12 maidens, returns to life seeking revenge. The film was advertised in Rhode Island newspapers as Crimson Demon, due to a practice at the time of deleting the word "Blood" from film titles.It was shot at the Bavaria Studios in Munich.
