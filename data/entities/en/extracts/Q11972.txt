The canton of Aargau (German: Kanton Aargau [ˈaːrɡaʊ] (listen); sometimes Latinized as Argovia; see also other names) is one of the more northerly cantons of Switzerland. It is situated by the lower course of the Aare, which is why the canton is called Aar-gau (meaning "Aare province"). It is one of the most densely populated regions of Switzerland.
