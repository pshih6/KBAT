Where the Truth Lies is a 2005 British-Canadian erotic thriller film written and directed by Atom Egoyan and starring Kevin Bacon, Colin Firth, and Alison Lohman. It is based on Rupert Holmes' 2003 novel of the same name.
The film alternates between 1957, when comedy duo Lanny Morris (Bacon) and Vince Collins (Firth) are at the height of their success, and 1972, when journalist Karen O'Connor (Lohman) is determined to unravel the mystery of a young woman found dead in their hotel suite 15 years before.
