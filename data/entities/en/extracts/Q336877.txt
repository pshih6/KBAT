Raymond William Stacy Burr (May 21, 1917 – September 12, 1993) was a Canadian-American actor primarily known for his title roles in the television dramas Perry Mason and Ironside. 
Burr's early acting career included roles on Broadway, radio, television, and film, usually as the villain. His portrayal of the suspected murderer in the Alfred Hitchcock thriller Rear Window (1954) is his best-known film role, although he is also remembered for his role in the 1956 film Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, which he reprised in the 1984 film Godzilla 1985. He won Emmy Awards for acting in 1959 and 1961 for the role of Perry Mason, which he played for nine seasons (1957–66) and reprised in a series of 26 Perry Mason TV movies (1985–93). His second TV series Ironside earned him six Emmy and two Golden Globe nominations.
Burr died of cancer in 1993, and his personal life came into question, as many details of his biography appeared to be unverifiable. He was ranked number 44 of the 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time by TV Guide magazine in 1996.
