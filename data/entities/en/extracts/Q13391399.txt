A chansonnier (female: chansonnière) was a poet songwriter, solitary singer, who sang his or her own songs (chansons) with a guitar, prominent in francophone countries during the 1960s and 1970s. Compared to the popular singer, the chansonnier needs no artifice to sing his/her soul poetry. They performed in «Les Boites à Chansons». which were flourishing in those years. The themes of their songs varied but included nature, love, simplicity, and a social interest to improve their world.
