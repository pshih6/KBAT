Oleśnica [ɔlɛɕˈɲit͡sa] (German: Oels; Silesian: Uoleśńica) is a town in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland. It is the administrative seat of Oleśnica County and also of the rural district of Gmina Oleśnica,  although it is not part of the territory of the latter, the town being an urban gmina in its own right.
The town is famed for its large 16th-century castle, which has previously been the seat of several dukes and lords. The castle's inner courtyard arcades, a masterpiece of Renaissance architecture, are iconic in the region.
