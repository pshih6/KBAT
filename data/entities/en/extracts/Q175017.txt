12 Paces Without a Head (German: Zwölf Meter ohne Kopf) is a 2009 film set in the North Sea in 1401.  The film centers on the German folk hero Klaus Störtebeker, who was a pirate at the time.  The title comes from a legend which asserts that when he was captured by the Hanseatic League, he struck a deal with his captors that every one of his men whom he could walk past after being decapitated, would be let go. Störtebeker's body allegedly managed to make twelve paces before collapsing.
