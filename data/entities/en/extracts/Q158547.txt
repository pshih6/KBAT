Neues Deutschland (nd) (English: New Germany, own notation: neues deutschland, abbr. nd) is a German daily newspaper, currently headquartered in Berlin. 
For 43 years it was the official party newspaper of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), which governed East Germany (officially known as the German Democratic Republic) as a dictatorship, and as such served as one of the party's most important organs. It originally had a Stalinist political stance; it retained a Marxist-Leninist stance until German reunification in 1990. The Neues Deutschland that existed in East Germany had a circulation of 1.1 million as of 1989 and was the communist party's main way to show citizens its stances and opinions about politics, economics, etc. It was regarded by foreign countries as the communist regime's diplomatic voice.
Since the fall of communism, the Neues Deutschland has lost 98% of its readership and has a circulation of 20,577 as of 2019. Since 1990 the newspaper has changed its political outlook and now has a democratic socialist political stance. The newspaper is both politically and financially tied to one of its part owners, The Left (Die Linke), which owns the publishing house and printing presses.
