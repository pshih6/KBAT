His book Twilight of the Wagners: The Unveiling of a Family's Legacy, an autobiography, queried the extent to which his father had extricated himself from the families close connection to National Socialism, while he has also been critical of many aspects of the Bayreuth Festival. The British film director Tony Palmer has made a two-hour documentary film about the Wagner family in which Gottfried plays a key role.
