The Free Territory of Trieste (Italian: Territorio libero di Trieste; Slovene: Svobodno tržaško ozemlje; Serbo-Croatian: Slobodni teritorij Trsta/Слободни Териориј Трста) was an independent territory situated in Central Europe between northern Italy and Yugoslavia, facing the north part of the Adriatic Sea, under direct responsibility of the United Nations Security Council in the aftermath of World War II.

The Free Territory was established on 10 February 1947 by a protocol of the Treaty of Peace with Italy in order to accommodate an ethnically and culturally mixed population in a neutral independent country. The intention was also to cool down territorial claims between Italy and Yugoslavia, due to its strategic importance for trade with Central Europe. It came into existence on 15 September 1947. Its administration was divided into two areas: one being the port city of Trieste with a narrow coastal strip to the north west (Zone A); the other (Zone B) was formed by a small portion of the north-western part of the Istrian peninsula.
The Free Territory was dissolved de facto and given to its two neighbours (Italy and Yugoslavia) in 1954. This was formalized much later by the bilateral Treaty of Osimo of 1975, ratified in 1977.
