Plague Ship is the 5th installment of The Oregon Files by Clive Cussler & Jack Du Brul. It recounts a series of violent viral attacks on cruise ships by extremists who want to make half the world's population sterile. The group, named "The Responsivists", is a thinly disguised cover for "Scientologists".
