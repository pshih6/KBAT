A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon, also known as Aren't You Even Gonna Kiss Me Goodbye?, is a 1988 American coming of age drama film written and directed by William Richert and starring River Phoenix, Ann Magnuson, Meredith Salenger, Matthew Perry, Ione Skye, and Louanne. It is based upon the novel Aren't You Even Gonna Kiss Me Goodbye?, also by William Richert. The story centers on a high school graduate who must decide if he wants to go to business school at the request of his father, or go his own way and find a full-time job, while also deciding on who he wants to be in life and if he should leave his house.
A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon was filmed in 1986 and released in early 1988. The released film deviates considerably from the original director's cut, which is now available under the title Aren't You Even Gonna Kiss Me Goodbye?.
