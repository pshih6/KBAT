The Académie royale de langue et de littérature françaises de Belgique - Royal Academy of French Language and Literature of Belgium -  or ARLLFB is a Belgian institution which brings together personalities who, through their works, writings, lectures or speeches, have contributed most eminently to the illustration of the French language, either by studying its origins and its evolution, or by publishing works of imagination or criticism. It includes both Belgian and foreign members.
The Royal Academy of French Language and Literature of Belgium, also named the "Destréenne", was founded in 1920 by king Albert I of Belgium, at the suggestion of Jules Destrée, minister in charge of Science and Arts. It should not be confused with the Royal Academy of Belgium, the "Teresian", founded in 1772 by Empress Maria Theresa of Austria.
