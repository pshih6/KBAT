Fritz Fischer (5 March 1908 â€“ 1 December 1999) was a German historian best known for his analysis of the causes of World War I. In the early 1960s Fischer advanced the controversial thesis that responsibility for the outbreak of the war rested solely on Imperial Germany. He has been described by John A. Moses as the most important German historian of the 20th century.
