Fidesz – Hungarian Civic Alliance (Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈfidɛs]; in full, Hungarian: Fidesz – Magyar Polgári Szövetség) is a national-conservative, right-wing populist political party in Hungary.
Founded in 1988 as a liberal youth party opposing the ruling communist government, Fidesz has come to dominate Hungarian politics on the national and local level since its landslide victory in the 2010 national elections on a joint list with the Christian Democratic People's Party, securing it a parliamentary supermajority that it retained in 2014 and again in 2018. Fidesz also enjoys majorities in the county legislatures (19 of 19), but it only has majorities in (10 of 23) assemblies in the cities with county rights and is currently in a minority (13 of 33) in the Budapest assembly. Viktor Orbán has been the leader of the party for most of its history.
