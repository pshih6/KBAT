Georges Charpentier (December 22, 1846 - November 15, 1905) was a 19th-century French publisher who became known as a champion of naturalist writers, especially Ã‰mile Zola, Gustave Flaubert, and Guy de Maupassant. He also promoted Impressionist painters and together with his wife, Marguerite Charpentier, built a small but significant art collection.
