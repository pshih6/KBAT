Miesbach was founded around the year 1000 and was for hundreds of years the seat of the County of Hohenwaldeck. In the 19th century it became the center of the conservation movement for the traditional costumes, the Tracht.
Miesbach also has a rich history as a pilgrimage and a mining village, which can still be seen in the city landscape.
On September 16, 1882, Miesbach became the starting point for the first long distance transmission of electric power in the world. A 1,343 voltage power transmission line transferred electricity from Miesbach over a distance of 35 miles (57 km) to Munich.
The starting point was the technologically advanced Miesbach mine, where electricity was generated using a steam engine. On the receiving end in the Munich Glass Palace, an electric pump powered an artificial waterfall. With this, Oskar von Miller and Marcel Deprez were able to show that electric power could indeed be transferred over long distances.
Miesbach is the birthplace of Verismo painter Christian Schad.
