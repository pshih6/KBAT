Vixen is an American rock band formed in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1980. During its most commercially successful period from 1987–1992, the band consisted of Jan Kuehnemund (lead guitar), Janet Gardner (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Share Ross (bass guitar), and Roxy Petrucci (drums).The band's eponymous first album was released in 1988, and reached  #41 on the Billboard 200. Their second album Rev It Up was released in 1990, and reached #52 on the Billboard 200. Their third album Tangerine was released in 1998. Their fourth album Live & Learn was released in 2006.
Part of the Los Angeles, California glam metal scene, the band has been described as "the female Bon Jovi." Several singles released by the band from 1988–1990 reached the Billboard Hot 100, including the Top 40 singles "Edge of a Broken Heart" at #26, and "Cryin'" at #22.
While the band originally disbanded in 1992, it reformed from 1997–1998 by Gardner and Petrucci but a lawsuit filed by Kuehnemund over ownership of the name ruled in her favor ending that version of the band. Kuehnemund reunited the band with the classic lineup in 2001 but disagreements caused Kuehnemund to quickly recruit a new version of the band with three new members; this lineup lasted until 2012. Kuehnemund died in 2013. From then on Gardner, Ross, and Petrucci reformed the band with Gina Stile on guitar. 
As of 2019 the band currently consists of Ross, Petrucci, Britt Lightning, and Lorraine Lewis.
