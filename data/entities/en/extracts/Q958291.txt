The United Principalities was the official name of the personal union of Moldavia and Wallachia which later became Romania, adopted on 24 January 1859 (O.S., 5 February N.S.) when Alexandru Ioan Cuza was elected as the Domnitor (Ruling Prince) of both principalities, which were autonomous but still vassals of the Ottoman Empire.
On 22 January 1862 (O.S., 3 February N.S.), the Principality of Moldavia and the Principality of Wallachia formally united to create the Romanian United Principalities, the core of the Romanian nation state. In 1866 a new constitution came into effect, giving the country the name of Romania. The new state remained nominally a vassal of the Ottoman Empire. However, by this time the suzerainity of the Sublime Porte had become a legal fiction. Romania had its own flag and anthem, and conducted its own foreign policy. From 1867, it had its own currency as well.
On 9 May 1877 (O.S., 21 May N.S.), Romania proclaimed itself fully independent, and on 14 March 1881 (O.S., 26 March N.S.), it became the Kingdom of Romania. After the First World War, Transylvania and other territories were also included.
