James "Jimmy" Honeyman-Scott (4 November 1956 â€“ 16 June 1982) was an English rock guitarist, songwriter, and founding member of the band The Pretenders.
With the Pretenders, Honeyman-Scott established a reputation, in the words of AllMusic, as "one of the most original and versatile guitarists of the early-'80s new wave movement." In addition to his role as lead guitarist, Honeyman-Scott co-wrote a number of songs for the band, sang back-up vocals, and played keyboards on a few tracks. The song "2000 Miles" was written for him by Chrissie Hynde and released the year after his death.
