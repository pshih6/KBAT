Hello! Project (ハロー!プロジェクト, Harō! Purojekuto) is a Japanese idol musical collective consisting of all female recording artists and groups under Up-Front Promotion, a subsidiary of Up-Front Group. The name was initially used as Michiyo Heike and Morning Musume's fan club name in 1999, but has since then been used to represent all female recording artists at Up-Front Promotion. Until 2014, their songs were primarily produced by Tsunku.
In the 2000s, the collective expanded to include sub-groups and project groups, such as Mini-Moni and Tanpopo, as well as other musical acts such as Berryz Kobo and Cute.
