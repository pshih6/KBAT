Terri Irwin  (née Raines; born July 20, 1964) is an American–Australian naturalist, conservationist, author, and the owner of Australia Zoo in Beerwah, Queensland. A native Oregonian from the United States, she began an independent animal rehabilitation center for injured predator mammals at age 22 while working for her family's trucking business.
While touring wildlife rehabilitation facilities in Australia in 1991, she had a chance meeting with naturalist Steve Irwin, whose father founded Australia Zoo. The two married in 1992, and went on to co-star in The Crocodile Hunter, their unconventional television nature documentary series and its spin-off series, Croc Files, The Crocodile Hunter Diaries, and Crikey! It's the Irwins. They had two children, Bindi and Robert, before Steve Irwin's death in 2006. She became a naturalised Australian citizen in 2009.
