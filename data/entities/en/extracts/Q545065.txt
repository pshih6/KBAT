Isaac Peral y Caballero (Cartagena, 1 June 1851 â€“ 22 May 1895, Berlin), was a Spanish engineer, naval officer and designer of the Peral Submarine.  He joined the Spanish navy in 1866, and developed the first electric-powered submarine which was launched in 1888, but it was not accepted by the naval authorities.  He then left the navy to develop other inventions commercially.
