Agnes Bertha Marshall (24 August 1855 â€“ 29 July 1905) was an English culinary entrepreneur. She became a leading cookery writer in the Victorian period, and was dubbed the "Queen of Ices" for her works on ice cream and other frozen desserts. In a time before practical domestic refrigeration, her success increased the demand in London for ice imported from Norway.
