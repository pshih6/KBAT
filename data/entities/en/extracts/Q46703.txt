The European Academy of Sciences and Arts (Latin: Academia Scientiarum et Artium Europaea) is a learned society of around 1,900 top scientists and artists who approach the questions facing Europe and the globe in various colloquia and publications. Among its members are 32 Nobel laureates. Not focused on financial gain, the academy is funded by the European Union, Austria, public agencies and private sponsors, while remaining ideologically and politically independent.
