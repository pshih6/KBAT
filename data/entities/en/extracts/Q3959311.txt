Sorcerer on the Rocks (妖術者 オンザロック, Mahotsukai on za Rokkus) also known as Chivas 1-2-3 (シーバス１-２-３, Chivas 1-2-3) is a spin-off of Sorcerer Hunters. The name was changed from Chivas 1-2-3 because ADV Films didn't want to get into a legal fight with the Whiskey company of the same name. So, the name of the OVAs and the first name of the hero were changed for the English Dub. The original story is by Satoru Akahori and Miku Yuki, and was published in Media Works' Monthly Dengeki Comic Gao!
