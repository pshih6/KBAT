Vasyl' Stus Donetsk National University (Vasyl' Stus DonNU) (Ukrainian: Донецький національний університет імені Василя Стуса, Donets’kyi Natsional’nyi Universytet; Russian: Донецкий национальный университет имени Васыля Стуса ) one of the leading higher educational institutions of Ukraine.  The University's history starts in 1937 from the moment of creation of a pedagogical institute in Donetsk (then Stalino).  In 1965, the Institute was transformed into Donetsk State University. It was accorded the National status in 2000.
In 2014, due to the War in Donbass, a number of teachers and students left Donetsk and subsequently reestablished the university as Vasyl' Stus Donetsk National University in Vinnytsia. At the same time, the majority of teachers and students remained in Donetsk, therefore splitting the university in two.
