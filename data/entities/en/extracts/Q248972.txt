Tom & Jerry Kids (also known as Tom & Jerry Kids Show) is a 1990-1993 American animated children's comedy television series co-produced by Hanna-Barbera and Turner Entertainment Co., and starring the cat-and-mouse duo Tom and Jerry as toddlers (kitten and mouse). It began airing as the first program of the FOX children's block, Fox Kids, on September 8, 1990.The series is somewhat similar to the "older" version of the original theatricals, partly akin to being produced by creators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, founders of H-B. In terms of violence level, they are far closer to the original cartoons than previous television incarnations such as Filmation's The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show although somewhat milder than Hanna and Barbera's version.
