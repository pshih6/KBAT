Stanislaus Pascal Franchot Tone (February 27, 1905 – September 18, 1968) was an American stage, film and television actor. He was Oscar-nominated for his role as Midshipman Roger Byam in Mutiny on the Bounty (1935). Tone was a leading man in the 1930s and early ‘40s, and at the height of his career was known for his gentlemanly, sophisticate roles, with supporting roles by the ‘50s. His acting crossed many genres including pre-Code romantic leads to Noir layered roles and many WWI films. He appeared as a guest star in episodes of several golden age television series, including The Twilight Zone and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour while continuing to act and produce in the theater and movies throughout the 1960s.
