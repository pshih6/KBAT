Mike Hedges is a British audio producer/engineer. Starting his career as a freelance engineer and producer in 1981, Mike helped to craft the sounds of The Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees from his own facility in Camden, the now legendary Playground.
Since then Mike has worked with an eclectic roster of artists ranging from rock and pop heavyweights such as U2, Dido, Manic Street Preachers, Travis, Texas, The Beautiful South and Everything But The Girl to cult-indie icons The Cooper Temple Clause and classically orientated projects, The Priests & Sarah Brightman.
Hedges' first major collaboration was with The Cure, and resulted in their debut single "Killing an Arab". Hedges opened his own facility, the Playground, designed by Acoustician Andy Munro, in nearby Camden Town where he continued to work with The Cure as well as with the Associates and Siouxsie and the Banshees.
