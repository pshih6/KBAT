Henry Luse Fuqua, Sr. (November 8, 1865 â€“ October 11, 1926), was an American businessman and, for his last two and a half years, a governor of Louisiana. During 1924, Fuqua defeated both Huey Pierce Long, Jr., and former Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives Hewitt Leonidas Bouanchaud to succeed John M. Parker in the state's governorship. He died halfway into his term, and lieutenant governor Oramel H. Simpson took over the top post.
