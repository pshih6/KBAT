Children of Bodom was a Finnish extreme metal band from Espoo. Formed in 1993 as Inearthed and splitting up in 2019, the final line-up of the group consisted of Alexi Laiho (lead guitar, lead vocals), Jaska Raatikainen (drums), Henkka Seppälä (bass guitar), Janne Wirman (keyboards), and Daniel Freyberg (rhythm guitar). The band released ten studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, two compilation albums and one DVD.
The band's third studio album, Follow the Reaper, was their first album to receive a gold certification in Finland, and subsequent studio albums acquired the same status. Three consecutive albums debuted at number one on the Finnish album charts, and have also seen chart positions on the United States Billboard 200.
The band incorporated many different musical styles, leading critics and fans to label their work as melodic death metal, death metal, power metal, and thrash metal. They are one of Finland's best selling artists of all time with more than 250,000 records sold there alone.
In 2019 Children of Bodom held their last concert before disbanding the band. Laiho and Freyberg carried on as Bodom After Midnight in 2020.
