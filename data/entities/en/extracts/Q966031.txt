A Republican, he was the state's thirtieth governor from 1967 to 1975. A native of Massachusetts, McCall grew up there and in central Oregon and attended the University of Oregon in Eugene. After college, he worked as a journalist, including time at The Oregonian in Portland during World War II.
Later he worked in radio and then in television as a newscaster and political commentator. He made an unsuccessful bid for Congress in 1954, losing in the general election to Edith Green. While working for TV station KGW, he produced a documentary on pollution in Oregon, which helped to spur environmental cleanup of the air and the Willamette River. In 1964, McCall won his first political office, Oregon Secretary of State, followed by two terms as governor, where he worked towards environmental cleanup, the bottle bill, and public ownership of beaches on the coast among others. Tom McCall Waterfront Park in Portland is one of several items named in his honor.
