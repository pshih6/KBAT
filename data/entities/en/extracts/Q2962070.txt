In film and television, a production designer (PD) is the person responsible for the overall visual look of the story. The production design gives the viewers a sense of the time period, the location where the protagonist is existing, what the characters are doing or feeling and why. Working directly with the director, cinematographer, and producer, they have a key creative role in the creation of motion pictures and television. The term production designer was coined by William Cameron Menzies while he was working on the film Gone with the Wind. Previously (and often subsequently) the people with the same responsibilities were called art directors; however, accurately, production designers decide the visual concept and manage the budget to create it while the art directors manage the process of making the visuals, which is done by graphic designers, set designers, costume designers, lighting designers, etc.
