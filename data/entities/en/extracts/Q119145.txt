Clemente Yerovi Indaburu (August 10, 1904 – July 19, 1981) was a politician and the interim president of Ecuador from March 30, 1966, to November 16, 1966.
Yerovi was born in Barcelona, Spain, where his parents Clemente Yerovi Matheus and María Indaburu Seminario lived temporarily as consul general of Ecuador.  Yerovi studied at Vicente Rocafuerte High School in Guayaquil, and then at San Gabriel High School in Quito.  He married Victoria Gómez Ycaza and had four children.  He had many links to agriculture on the coast of the country, where he acquired a farm, that split in parts among its workers. Yerovi tenure is remembered by most Ecuadorians as a time of peace and prosperity. Even though Yerovi was not elected by popular vote, Ecuadorians are very fond of his persona, erecting many monuments and naming avenues with his name. 
In 1948 he was economy minister of Galo Plaza's government, and then senator for agriculture.
Yerovi died in Guayaquil, Ecuador.
