Totally Spies! is an animated television series created by Vincent Chalvon-Demersay and David Michel and mainly produced by French company Marathon Media (and co-produced with Canadian company Image Entertainment Corporation for seasons 3 to 5). The show was made to resemble anime in artwork and was originally based on the concept of a girl group. It focuses on three teenage girls in Beverly Hills, California, United States, who work as undercover super agents.
Totally Spies! was first seen on November 3, 2001, on ABC Family (now Freeform) in the United States before moving to Cartoon Network less than 2 years later.  It premiered on TF1 in France on 3 April 2002, and on Teletoon in Canada on September 2, 2002. Since the series debut, 156 episodes have been broadcast, completing its sixth season to date, that includes several specials.
Several products tied to the series have been released, which include a series of comic books, novels and video games. A prequel theatrical movie production named Totally Spies! The Movie, made and released between the fifth and sixth seasons and co-produced with Italy, was released in 2009 in France.
