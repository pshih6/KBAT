Karl Freiherr von Vincke (also Carl von Vincke;  von Vincke-Olbendorf, 1800â€“1869) was a Prussian officer and politician. 
He was a member of the baronial Vincke family, a cousin of liberal politician Georg von Vincke. 
He served in the Prussian Army from 1817, from 1829 in the general staff, from 
1832 in the rank of captain in VI. Armee-Korps. He participated in the military reform of the Ottoman army as an advisor from 1837, and participated in the war in Egypt in 1840. Later in 1840, he was promoted to major and reassigned to the Gardekorps.
He left the active service in 1843, but remained in the army until 1850, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. 
From 1843, he began to participate in politics on the liberal party even while maintaining a personal friendship with William I, German Emperor, facilitating both his escape into exile following the March Revolution of 1848, and his return later in June of the same year.
