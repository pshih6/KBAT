Anitta Müller-Cohen born Rosenzweig (1890–1962) was an Austrian-born Jewish woman who emigrated to Tel Aviv, Palestine, in 1935. In Austria, she was a prominent social worker, politician and writer who became increasingly interested in Zionism. One of the leading members of Vienna's Jewish National Party, she organized and actively contributed to the First World Congress of Jewish Women which was held in Vienna in May 1923. At the American Jewish Congress in Chicago in 1925, she addressed the opening session. After emigrating to Palestine in 1935, she became a member of the Mizrahi Women’s Organization, founded the Women's Social Service, and continued her welfare work which was mainly concerned with children and immigrants.
