Cesáreo González Rodríguez (1903 – 1968) was a Spanish film producer.
González was born in 1903 in Vigo, Spain.  When he was 12, he took a boat to Cuba and worked as a salesman.  He would later work in Mexico at his uncle's bakery, and return to Spain as a young adult.
In 1940, he began a production company called Suevia Films.  Its first release was Stowaway on Board (1941), a film starring Florian Rey, in 1941.  He would go on to produce over 100 films.  González chose local Spanish talent to act and perform music in his films, such as folk singer Lola Flores, actress María Félix, comedian Pepe Iglesias, and child prodigy Joselito.  He would later produce under the name Cesáreo González Producciones Cinematográficas.  He died in Madrid in 1968.
