James Ford Rhodes (May 1, 1848 – January 22, 1927), was an American industrialist and historian born in Cleveland, Ohio. After earning a fortune in the iron, coal, and steel industries by 1885, he retired from business. He devoted his life to historical research and publishing a seven-volume history of the United States beginning in 1850; his work was published from 1893–1906. He published an eighth volume in 1920. His work, History of the Civil War, 1861–1865 (1918), won the second-ever Pulitzer Prize for History that year.
