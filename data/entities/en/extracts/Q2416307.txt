Outsider music (from "outsider art") is music created by self-taught or na√Øve musicians. The term is usually applied to musicians from outside the music establishment who exhibit childlike qualities, and especially those who suffer from intellectual disabilities or mental illnesses. The term was popularized in the 1990s by journalist and WFMU DJ Irwin Chusid.Outsider musicians often overlap with lo-fi artists, since their work is rarely captured in professional recording studios. Examples  include Daniel Johnston, Wesley Willis, and Jandek, who each became the subjects of documentary films in the 2000s.
