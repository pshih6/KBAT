Desiré Delano "Dési" Bouterse (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈdesɪ ˈbʌutərsə]; born 13 October 1945) is a Surinamese politician who has been President of Suriname since 2010. From 1980 to 1987 he was Suriname's de facto leader after conducting a military coup and establishing a period of military rule.
Bouterse is the chairman of the Surinamese political alliance Megacombinatie ("Mega combination") and the leader of the National Democratic Party (NDP), which is part of the Megacombination. On 19 July 2010, Bouterse was elected as President of Suriname with 36 of 50 parliament votes and on 12 August 2010 he was inaugurated.Bouterse is a controversial figure, held responsible by some for numerous human rights violations committed during his military rule in the 1980s. Most notable was the December murders in 1982 of fifteen leading opposition figures. He was prosecuted for the murders and a trial was initiated, but the National Assembly extended amnesty to him in 2012. After the trial was forced to continue, Bouterse was sentenced to 20 years in prison on the 29 of November 2019. He is also suspected of having directed the Moiwana massacre in 1986 during the civil war by the Maroons, led by his former bodyguard.
On 16 July 1999, Bouterse was sentenced in absentia in the Netherlands to 11 years' imprisonment after being convicted of trafficking 474 kg (1,045 lb) of cocaine. Bouterse always claimed innocence; he claimed that the star witness in the case, Patrick van Loon, was bribed by the Dutch government.
According to WikiLeaks cables released in 2011, Bouterse was active in the drug trade until 2006. Europol has issued an arrest warrant for him. As Suriname's president, he enjoys national immunity from arrest in his country. Because Bouterse was convicted of the drug offense before his election in 2010 as head of state, he enjoys no international immunity on these charges.
