Antonio de Aguiar Patriota (born April 27, 1954 in Rio de Janeiro) is the current Ambassador of Brazil to Egypt and former Minister of External Relations. Patriota took office as foreign minister on January 1, 2011 and remained in office until August 26, 2013.
A graduate in philosophy from the University of Geneva and later international relations by the Rio Branco Institute, Patriota has taken prominent positions within the foreign service such as Brazil's ambassador to the United States between 2007 and 2009, Deputy Secretary General for Political Affairs of the Ministry of External Relations, Cabinet Chief of Foreign Minister Chancellor Celso Amorim and Secretary General of the Ministry of External Relations. He was replaced as Minister of External Relations by Luiz Figueiredo. This replacement was caused by Patriota's deemed responsibility in the operation that transported Bolivian Senator Roger Pinto Molina from the Brazilian Embassy in La Paz to the Brazilian border. Senator Molina had sought refuge in the Brazilian Embassy for 15 months.
