The Big Cat is a 1949 American outdoor action film in Technicolor directed by Phil Karlson.  The cast included Lon McCallister, Peggy Ann Garner, Preston Foster, Forrest Tucker, Skip Homeier, and Gene Reynolds.
Karlson said the film "was a complete social statement. That was my answer to John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath."
