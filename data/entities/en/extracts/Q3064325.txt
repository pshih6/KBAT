The facult√© des lettres de Paris was a French educational institution based at the Sorbonne. It was set up by the imperial decree regarding the University of France on 17 March 1808. It partly succeeded the arts faculty of the former University of Paris. In 1896 it was joined to four other faculties in Paris to form the new University of Paris. Following the loi Faure of 8 October 1970, it was divided into the universities Paris-I, Paris-III, Paris-IV, Paris-V and Paris-VII in 1970.
