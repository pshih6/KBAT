The Académie d'architecture is a French learned society whose purpose is the recognition of architectural quality. Founded in 1840 as the Société Centrale des Architectes, the society was renamed Académie d'Architecture in 1953, reviving the name of the former Académie Royale d'Architecture, founded in 1671 by Jean-Baptiste Colbert.
