Theodor Nöldeke (born March 2, 1836 in Harburg, (Hamburg today), died December 25, 1930 in Karlsruhe) was a German orientalist and scholar.  His research interests ranged over Old Testament studies, Semitic languages and Arabic, Persian and Syriac literature. Nöldeke translated several important works of oriental literature and during his lifetime was considered an important orientalist. He wrote numerous studies (including on the Qur’ān) and contributed articles to the Encyclopædia Britannica. 
Among the projects Nöldeke collaborated on was Michael Jan de Goeje’s published edition of al-Tabari's Tarikh ("Universal History"), for which he translated the Sassanid-era section. This translation remains of great value, particularly for the extensive supplementary commentary.
His numerous students included Charles Cutler Torrey, Louis Ginzberg and Friedrich Zacharias Schwally.  He entrusted Schwally with the continuation of his standard work "The History of the Qur’ān".
