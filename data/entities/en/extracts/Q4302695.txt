Shigeki Mori (森 茂喜, Mori Shigeki)(27 March 1910 – 19 November 1989) was a Japanese businessman and politician, mayor of Neagari, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan, father of a former Japanese prime minister Yoshirō Mori.
During his term, he developed a relationship with the Siberian town of Shelekhov, particularly a bilateral dialogue to improve the gravesites of Soviet soldiers in Japan and Japanese soldiers in Siberia; he was so close to Russia that Japanese authorities monitored him closely as a potential communist sympathizer. He visited Shelekhov more than 15 times during his 35 years in office, and part of his ashes were buried there following his death.
