The Jura Mountains ( JOOR-ə, ZHOOR-ə, French: [ʒyʁa] (listen), German: [ˈjuːra] (listen), locally [ˈjuːɾa]; French: Massif du Jura; German: Juragebirge; Italian: Massiccio del Giura) are a sub-alpine mountain range located north of the Western Alps, mainly following the course of the France–Switzerland border. 
The Jura separates the  Rhine and Rhône basins, forming part of the watershed of each. 
The name "Jura" is derived from juria, a Latinized form of a  Celtic stem jor- "forest". 
The mountain range gives its name to the French department of Jura, the Swiss Canton of Jura, the Jurassic period of the geologic timescale, and the Montes Jura of the Moon.
