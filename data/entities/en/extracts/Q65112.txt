Marmorera (German: Marmels) is a village and former municipality in the Sursés in the district of Albula in the canton of Graubünden in Switzerland.  On 1 January 2016 the former municipalities of Bivio, Cunter, Marmorera, Mulegns, Riom-Parsonz, Salouf, Savognin, Sur and Tinizong-Rona merged to form the new municipality of Surses.Until the end of the 19th century, its population was almost exclusively Romansh-speaking. This figure has however since been in decline, with its 2000 census reporting that 57% of the population now declared German as a first language.
The old village was destroyed and flooded when the Marmorera dam was constructed. The current village was built above Lai da Marmorera.
