After graduating from the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama in 1957, he trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, and was then spotted by Laurence Olivier who invited him to join the Royal National Theatre in 1965. Productions at the National included King Lear, his favourite Shakespeare play. Despite his success in theatre, Hopkins yearned to be on screen. His last stage play was a West End production of M. Butterfly in 1989.
In 1968, Hopkins achieved renown in film, playing Richard the Lionheart in The Lion in Winter. In the mid-1970s, Richard Attenborough, who would direct five Hopkins films, called him "the greatest actor of his generation." In 1991 he portrayed Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. He reprised the role in its sequel Hannibal and the prequel Red Dragon. Hopkins was nominated for four other Academy Awards for the films, The Remains of the Day (1993), Nixon (1995), Amistad (1997) and The Two Popes (2019).
