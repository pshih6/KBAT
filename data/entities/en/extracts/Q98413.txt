Ellen Aurora Elisabeth Morgenröte Ammann  (1 July 1870 - 23 November 1932) was a German politician and activist, representative of the Bavarian People's Party.
She worked for Swedish-German women's rights, and was a welfare nurse and pioneer of professional training for social work. From 1919 to 1932, she served as a “landtag” deputy for “Bavarian People’s Party”, where she advocated the professionalisation of women's education. In January 1923, together with Anita Augspurg and a delegation of women, Amman called for Hitler to be expelled from Germany. During the Hitler Putsch, she and several members of government hastily composed a condemnation of the attempted coup d'état. She continued to oppose National Socialism until her death.
