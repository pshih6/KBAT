International DeeJay Gigolo Records is a German electronic music record label run by techno artist DJ Hell (real name Helmut Geier). The label was founded in Munich in 1996 as an affiliate of label Disko B. It is Germany's most successful electronic music record label, specialising in electro, house and techno with 80's pop and disco influences. "Gigolo" has released records by Dave Clarke, Jeff Mills, DJ Hell, David Carretta, Miss Kittin & The Hacker, Kiko & Gino S., DJ Naughty, The Penelopes, The Advent, Dopplereffekt, Terrence Fixmer, Japanese Telecom, Fischerspooner, Tiga, Belgian Dj Valium, Princess Superstar and Vitalic. In particular, the label is widely credited as being the germ cell of the electroclash music genre in the late 1990s.Gigolo's most successful release came in 2001, with Vitalic's Poney EP (which included techno favourite "La Rock 01" on the B-side). This EP was remastered and re-issued in 2006. The label also releases showcase compilations, sometimes called "We Are Gigolo", of which there are now twelve volumes. After several successful years in Munich, the label moved its office to Berlin in the mid-2000s.
