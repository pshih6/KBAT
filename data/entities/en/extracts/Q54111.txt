Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the Neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century in Italy and France. In its purest form, it is a style principally derived from the architecture of Classical antiquity, the Vitruvian principles, and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio.The development of archaeology was crucial in the emergence of Neoclassical architecture. Excavation sites like those in Pompeii and Herculaneum allowed architects to make in depth interpretations of Classical architecture and synthesize their own unique style.In form, Neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts. The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament, and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition. Therefore, the style defined by symmetry, simple geometry, and social demands instead of ornament. Neoclassical architecture is still designed today, but may be labelled New Classical architecture for contemporary buildings.
In Central and Eastern Europe, the style is usually referred to as 'Classicism', while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called Neoclassical.
