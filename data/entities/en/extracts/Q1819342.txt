St Anne's College is a constituent college of the University of Oxford in England. Once a women's college, it has been coeducational since 1979. Founded in 1879, it received full college status in 1952. It has some 450 undergraduate and 200 graduate students, and retains an original aim of allowing women of any financial background to study at Oxford. A recent admissions report shows St Anne's accepting the highest proportion of female students (55%) of any college. It stands between the Woodstock and Banbury roads, adjacent to the University Parks and the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter. In April 2017, Helen King, a retired Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner, became Principal in succession to Tim Gardam. Alumnae include Danny Alexander, Ruth Deech, Helen Fielding, Martha Kearney, Simon Rattle and Victor Ubogu.
