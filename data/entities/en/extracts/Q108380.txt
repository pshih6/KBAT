Retaining that position until October 1943, Bomhard took an important role in ideological instruction of the Ukrainian police in the Nazi Weltanschauung.After the Second World War ended, Bomhard served between 1960 and 1966 as mayor of Prien am Chiemsee and received honorary citizenship there in 1971 which was posthumously renounced by the city council in 2013.
