Too Hot to Handle, also known as Let 'Em All Talk, is a 1938 comedy-drama directed by Jack Conway and starring Clark Gable, Myrna Loy, and Walter Pidgeon. The plot concerns a newsreel reporter, the female aviator he is attracted to (influenced by Amelia Earhart, who had disappeared 14 months earlier) and his fierce competitor. Many of the comedy gags were devised by an uncredited Buster Keaton.
