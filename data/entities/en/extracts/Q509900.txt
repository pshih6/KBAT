Santiago Segura Silva (born 17 July 1965 in Madrid) is a Spanish actor, screenwriter, director and producer of Spanish cinema, popular for its pentalogy film series Torrente. He also worked to a lesser extent as a TV presenter, voice actor and comic writer, as well as being an original collector.
At 12, he began making films with a Super-8 camera, and, after a recommendation from Fernando Trueba, began to make films in 35 mm, funded by his appearances in TV game shows. Fame would come with his first feature, Torrente, el brazo tonto de la ley, to be followed by numerous sequels that would make it the highest grossing Spanish film series.
