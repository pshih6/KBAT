Areva S.A. was a French multinational group specializing in nuclear power and renewable energy headquartered in Paris, France. Before its 2016 corporate restructuring, Areva was majority-owned by the French state through the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (54.37%), Banque publique d'investissement (3.32%), and Agence des participations de l'État (28.83%). Électricité de France, of which the French government has a majority ownership stake, owned 2.24%; Kuwait Investment Authority owned 4.82% as the second largest shareholder after the French state. The company was listed at the European stock exchange Euronext. 
As a part of the restructuring program following its insolvency, Areva sold out or discontinued its renewable energy businesses, sold its reactors business subsidiary Areva NP (now: Framatome) to EDF and its nuclear propulsion and research reactors subsidiary Areva TA (now: Technicatome) to Agence des participations de l'État, and separated its nuclear cycle business into a separate company New Areva (later: Orano). As a result, Areva S.A. became wholly state-owned by the French government, remaining responsible only for the liabilities related to the Olkiluoto 3 project in Finland and holding a 40% stake in Orano.
