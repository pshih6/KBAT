Plotius Tucca (fl. 35 BC) was a Roman poet and a friend of Virgil. He was in the circle of friends with Virgil and Maecenas, as indicated by Horace (Satires). According to Donatus's Life of Virgil, after Virgil's death, Plotius was one of two executors of Virgil's literary remainsâ€”one of two who helped publish the Aeneid on Augustus's orders (the other being Varius Rufus).
Plotius is known today only in connection with the poetry of Horace and Virgil.
