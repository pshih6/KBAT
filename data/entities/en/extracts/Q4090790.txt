Bolesław V of Warsaw (pl: Bolesław V warszawski; ca. 1453 - 27 April 1488), was a Polish prince member of the House of Piast in the Masovian branch. He was a Duke of Czersk, Liw, Warsaw, Nur, Łomża, Ciechanów, Różan, Zakroczym and Wyszogród during 1454-1471 jointly with his brothers (under regency until 1462), Duke of Płock, Wizna, Płońsk and Zawkrze during 1462-1471, and after the division of the paternal domains in 1471, sole ruler over Warsaw, Nur and Liw. In 1484 he abdicated his rule over Błonie, Tarczyn, Kamieniec and Zakroczym.
He was the seventh son of Bolesław IV of Warsaw and Barbara Aleksandrówna, a Lithuanian princess, (granddaughter of Vladimir Olgerdovich). The premature death from four of his older brothers during 1452-1454 left him as the third surviving son of his family.
