Hermann Röchling (12 November 1872 – 24 August 1955) was a German steel manufacturer in the Saar (Germany) and Lorraine (France) in the 20th century. 
He was a paternalistic and well-liked employer, concerned about his workers' health and welfare.
After World War I (1914–18) he was accused of the war crime of destroying French factories.
Although he was acquitted, his French property was not returned, and he became deeply hostile to France.
He was a Pan-German nationalist and strongly antisemitic.
After the accession of Adolf Hitler he became an influential member of the Nazi Party.
During World War II (1939–45) he was made responsible for coordination of the iron and steel industry in occupied Lorraine, and later in the whole of Germany and the occupied territories.
He used prisoners of war for forced labor in the steel works.
After the war he was tried and convicted for human rights violations, although as an old man he was released before serving his full term.
