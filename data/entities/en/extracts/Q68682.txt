The Bukharan People's Soviet Republic (Uzbek: Buxoro Xalq Sovet Respublikasi, Бухоро Халқ Совет Республикаси; Tajik: Ҷумҳурии Халқии Шӯравии Бухоро; Russian: Бухарская Народная Советская Республика, tr. Bukharskaya Narodnaya Sovetskaya Respublika) was a short-lived Soviet state that governed the former Emirate of Bukhara during the years immediately following the Russian Revolution. In 1924, its name was changed to the Bukharan Socialist Soviet Republic (Bukharan SSR; Russian: Бухарская Социалистическая Советская Республика). After the redrawing of regional borders, its territory was assigned mostly to the Uzbek SSR and some to the Turkmen SSR.
