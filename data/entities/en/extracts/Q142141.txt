Mikhail Nikolayevich Tukhachevsky (Russian: Михаил Николаевич Тухачевский, IPA: [tʊxɐˈtɕefskʲɪj]; 16 February [O.S. 4 February] 1893 – 12 June 1937) nicknamed Red Napoleon by foreign newspapers, was a leading Soviet military leader and theoretician from 1918 to 1937. 
From 1920–1921 he commanded the Soviet Western Front in the Polish–Soviet War. Soviet forces under his command successfully repelled the Polish forces from Western Ukraine, driving them back to Poland, but the Red Army was defeated outside of Warsaw, and the war ended in Soviet defeat. He later served as chief of staff of the Red Army from 1925 through 1928, as assistant in the People's Commissariat of Defense after 1934 and as commander of the Volga Military District in 1937. He achieved the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1935.
He was a major proponent of the modernization of Soviet armament and army force structure in the 1920s and 1930s and became instrumental in the development of Soviet aviation, mechanized, and airborne forces. As a theoretician, he was a driving force behind Soviet development of the theory of deep operations. The Soviet authorities falsely accused him of  treason and had him shot during Stalin's military purges of 1937–1938, but rehabilitated his reputation in the late 1950s.
