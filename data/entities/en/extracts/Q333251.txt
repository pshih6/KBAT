Peter Bradford Benchley (May 8, 1940 â€“ February 11, 2006) was an American author, screenwriter, and ocean activist. He wrote the bestselling novel Jaws and co-wrote its film adaptation with Carl Gottlieb. Several more of his works were also adapted for both cinema and television, including The Deep, The Island, Beast, and White Shark.
Later in life, Benchley came to regret writing such sensationalist literature about sharks, which he felt encouraged excessive fear and unnecessary culls of such an important predator in ocean ecosystems and became an  advocate for marine conservation.
