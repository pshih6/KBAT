Intimacy is a 2001 film directed by Patrice Chéreau, starring Mark Rylance and Kerry Fox. It is an international co-production among production companies in France, the U.K., Germany, and Spain featuring a soundtrack of pop songs from the 1970s and 1980s. It was written by Chéreau with Anne-Louise Trividic, based on stories by Hanif Kureishi (who also wrote a novel of the same title). This mainstream-defined film contains an unsimulated fellatio scene by Fox on Rylance. A French-dubbed version features voice actors Jean-Hugues Anglade and Nathalie Richard.
The film has been associated with the New French Extremity.
