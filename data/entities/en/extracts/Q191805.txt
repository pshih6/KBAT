Mladá Boleslav (Czech pronunciation: [ˈmladaː ˈbolɛslaf]; German: Jungbunzlau; both meaning "New (or literally Young) Boleslav") is a statutory city in the north of the Czech Republic, on the left bank of the Jizera river about 50 kilometres (31 miles) northeast of Prague. It is the second biggest city in the Central Bohemian Region and a major centre of the Czech automotive industry (Škoda Auto). The city name abbreviation MB became eponymous for colloquial naming of Škoda cars (especially in the communist era) as "embé(čko)".
