Filipp Ivanovich Golikov (Russian: Фили́пп Ива́нович Го́ликов; July 30, 1900 – July 29, 1980) was a Soviet military commander. As chief of the GRU, he is best known for not taking seriously the abundant intelligence about Nazi Germany's plans for an invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, either because he did not believe them or because Joseph Stalin made it very clear he did not want to hear them. He was promoted to the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1961.
