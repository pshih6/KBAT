Hermann Karl Lenz (26 February 1913 in Stuttgart – 12 May 1998 in Munich) was a German writer of poetry, fiction stories, and novels. A major part of his work includes 10 volumes in a semi-autobiographical novel cycle about the alter-ego figure "Eugen Rapp". In the 1970s he published the 7-volume Schwäbische Chronik ("Swabian Chronicle").
Lenz had been a German POW in U.S. custody during World War II. He received over 15 literary awards. Archives of his writings include some letters exchanged with his fellow writers Paul Celan and Peter Handke and others (see below: "Correspondence").
