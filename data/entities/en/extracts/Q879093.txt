Bolesław Ignacy Florian Wieniawa-Długoszowski (22 July 1881 – 1 July 1942) was a Polish general, adjutant to Chief of State Józef Piłsudski, politician, freemason, diplomat, poet, artist, and formally, for one day, President of the Republic of Poland. He was one of the generation that fought for, and saw, the rebirth of an independent Poland on 11/11/1918 (National Independence Day (Poland)) only to see that independence lost again, following the 1939 division of Poland between Germany and the Soviet Union pursuant to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.
