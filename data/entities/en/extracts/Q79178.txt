Grete Wiesenthal (December 9, 1885, Vienna - June 22, 1970, Vienna) was a member of the corps de ballet of the Hofoper in Vienna. Gustav Mahler was responsible for giving her the role of 'Fenella' in La Muette de Portici in 1907.  This caused a great scandal and eventually led to Mahler's resignation, as in doing so, he had undermined the ballet master, Hassreiter.
