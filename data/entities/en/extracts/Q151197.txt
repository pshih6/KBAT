A combat engineer (also called field engineer, pioneer or sapper) in many armies is a soldier who performs a variety of construction and demolition tasks under combat conditions.
The combat engineer's goals involve facilitating movement and support of friendly forces while impeding those of the enemy. Combat engineers build fighting positions, fortifications, and roads. They conduct demolitions missions and clear minefields using specialized vehicles. Typical combat engineer missions include construction and breaching of trenches, tank traps and other fortifications; bunker construction; bridge and road construction or destruction; laying or clearing land mines; and combined arms breaching. Typically, a combat engineer is also trained as an infantryman, and combat engineer units frequently fight alongside the infantry or fight as infantry as a secondary mission.
