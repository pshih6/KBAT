Ludwig Johannes Herbert Martin Münchmeyer (June 2, 1885, Hoel, Province of Hanover – July 24, 1947) was an Evangelical German pastor known for antisemitism. He led an "antisemitic spa" on the island of Borkum. He won a libel suit against Bruno Weil, but enough of the allegations of loose morals and scandalous misconduct against him were confirmed that he was defrocked. He later acted as a prominent Nazi speaker after leaving the German National People's Party. He also propagandized for the Nazi Party in Weser-Ems.
