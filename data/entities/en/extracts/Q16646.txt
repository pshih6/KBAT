The Hoher Kasten is a mountain in the Appenzell Alps, overlooking the Rhine in Eastern Switzerland. It is located on the border between the cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden and St. Gallen.
The summit is easily accessible with a cable car starting at Br√ºlisau, south of Appenzell. A revolving restaurant, offering panoramic views, has been built on the top.
Ascents to Hoher Kasten and the neighouring summit Kamor were already described in the early 19th century.
