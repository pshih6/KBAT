A slasher film is a subgenre of horror films involving a killer murdering a group of people, usually by use of bladed tools. Although the term "slasher" is often used informally as a generic term for any horror film involving murder, film analysts cite an established set of characteristics which set these films apart from other subgenres, such as splatter films and psychological horror films.Critics cite the Italian giallo films and psychological horror films such as Peeping Tom (1960) and Psycho (1960) as early influences. The genre hit its peak between 1978–1984 in an era referred to as the "Golden Age" of slasher films. Notable slasher films include: The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), Black Christmas (1974), Halloween (1978), The Toolbox Murders (1978), Friday the 13th (1980), My Bloody Valentine (1981), The Burning (1981), The Prowler (1981), Graduation Day (1981), The Slumber Party Massacre (1982), The House on Sorority Row (1982), Sleepaway Camp (1983), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), Child's Play (1988), Candyman (1992), Leprechaun (1993), Scream (1996), I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) and Urban Legend (1998). Many slasher films released decades ago continue to attract cult followings. The slasher canon is divided into three eras: the classical (1974–1993), the self-referential (1994–2000) and the neoslasher cycle (2000–2013).
