Arturo Bocchini (Italian pronunciation: [arˈturo bokˈkini]; 12 February 1880 – 20 November 1940) was Italy's Chief of Police under the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. He was a key figure in the Italian fascist regime from 1926 until his death. Bocchini headed both the regular police (Polizia di Stato) and the secret political police (OVRA) which was a pervasive national security agency that operated at all levels of Italian society. Bocchini only reported  directly to the Duce and operated autonomously without interference from the National Fascist Party and the state prefects. His power and reach within the government led to him being called the "deputy".
