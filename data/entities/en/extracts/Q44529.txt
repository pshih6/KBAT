He is considered one of Argentina's best film directors and most enduring cultural figures as well as a popular singer-songwriter throughout Latin America.Much beloved in Latin America, he was one of the most successful Argentine singers in the 1960s and 1970s with big hits like Ding, dong estas cosas del amor (with Carola), O quizás simplemente le regale una rosa, Fuiste mía un verano, Ella ya me olvidó, Quiero aprender de memoria, Mi tristeza es mía y nada más, Para saber cómo es la soledad, Mi amante niña mi compañera, Ni el clavel ni la rosa, La foto de carnet, No jueges más, Chiquillada and La cita and starred in many films.Without detriment to his outstanding career as a singer and songwriter, at the time he began to sing in public, he was already an established film director.
