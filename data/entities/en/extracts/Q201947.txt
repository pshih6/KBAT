Aosdána (; from Irish aos dána [iːsˠ ˈd̪ˠɑːnˠə] "people of the arts") is an Irish association of artists. It was created in 1981 on the initiative of a group of writers with support from the Arts Council of Ireland. Membership, which is by invitation from current members, is limited to 250 individuals; before 2005 it was limited to 200. Its governing body is called the Toscaireacht.
