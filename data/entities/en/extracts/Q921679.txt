Jason Andrew Molina (December 30, 1973 â€“ March 16, 2013) was an American musician and singer-songwriter. Raised in northern Ohio, he came to prominence performing and recording as Songs: Ohia, both in solo projects and with a rotating cast of musicians in the late 1990s. Beginning in 2003, he would garner a further indie following for his releases with the band Magnolia Electric Co.
Molina had a prolific career between his two musical projects and solo releases, producing a total of sixteen studio albums, eight EPs, and numerous singles. His overall discography was noted by critics for blending elements of indie rock, blues, and alternative country with his tenor vocal range.
In 2009, Molina canceled a tour with Magnolia Electric Co., citing health problems as the reason. He spent the next four years dealing with alcoholism, which ultimately resulted in his death from multiple organ failure in March 2013.
