François Jacques Dominique Massieu (4 August 1832 – 5 February 1896) was a French thermodynamics engineer noted for his two 1869 characteristic functions, each of which known as a Massieu function (the first of which sometimes called free entropy), as cited by American engineer Willard Gibbs in his 1876 On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances.
