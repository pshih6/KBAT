While appearing in a 2003 production of As You Like It, Howard caught the attention of director M. Night Shyamalan, who cast her in the psychological thriller The Village (2004). It proved to be her breakout role and she subsequently starred in the title role of Shyamalan's fantasy thriller Lady in the Water (2006). Her performance in Kenneth Branagh's As You Like It (2006) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination, and she appeared as Gwen Stacy in Sam Raimi's superhero film Spider-Man 3 (2007). Howard went on to appear in the action film Terminator Salvation (2009) and the fantasy film The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010), both of which were financially successful but garnered mixed reviews from critics. Howard had supporting roles in the acclaimed 2011 comedy-dramas 50/50 and The Help. She gained wider recognition for starring as Claire Dearing in the adventure film Jurassic World (2015) and its sequel Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), which rank as her most financially successful films.
