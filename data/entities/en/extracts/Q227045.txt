Zouk is a culture and art movement that was created in the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique popularized by the French Antillean band Kassav' in the 1980s. The music of Kassav is an extension of biguine, Gwo ka and cadence-lypso or compas  bands, such as Grammacks, Exile One, Les Aiglons and Experience 7 of the 1970s. Very rapid in tempo, it lost ground in the 1980s due to the strong presence of compas / kompa and kadans, the main music of the French Antilles. Today, zouk is the French Antilles compas (Kompa), also called zouk-love.
Examples of Zouk singers: Francky Vincent, Edith Lefel, Fanny J, Alan Cavé, Lynnsha, Patrick Saint-Éloi, Jocelyne Béroard, Kaysha, Soumia, Elizio, Mario Chicot.
