Charles Louis Fleischmann (November 3, 1835 – December 10, 1897) was an innovative manufacturer of yeast and other consumer food products during the 19th century. In the late 1860s, he and his brother Maximilian created America’s first commercially produced yeast, which revolutionized baking in a way that made today’s mass production and consumption of bread possible.
