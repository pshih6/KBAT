Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a 1998 American psychedelic satirical black comedy road film adapted from Hunter S. Thompson's  novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. It was co-written and directed by Terry Gilliam, and stars Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro as Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo, respectively. The film details the duo's journey through Las Vegas as their initial journalistic intentions devolve into an exploration of the city under the influence of psychoactive substances.
The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a financial failure, but has since become a cult classic among film fans. Depp briefly reprised his role as Duke in a cameo appearance in Rango (2011), in addition to voicing the title character.
