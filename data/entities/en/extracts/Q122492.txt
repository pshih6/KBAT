Bea Wyler (born 1951 in Baden, Switzerland) is the second female rabbi in Germany (the first being Regina Jonas) and the first to officiate at a congregation. She was ordained by the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York in 1995, and that year she was appointed to serve the Conservative Jewish synagogue of Oldenburg. Her appointment was much criticized by the head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. As of 2000 she was Germany's only Conservative rabbi. She served as a rabbi in Oldenburg until 2004, and as a rabbi in Brunswick and Delmenhorst until 2004.
