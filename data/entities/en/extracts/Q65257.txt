Reinmar von Zweter (also spelled Reymar von Zwetel, Reymar von Zweten, RÃ¶mer von Zwickau, Ehrenbote, born around 1200 in Zeutern, today known as Ubstadt-Weiher, Germany; died after 1248) was a Middle High German  poet of Spruchdichtung.  The iconography in the Manesse Codex (see illustration) suggests that he may have been blind, since he is the only person represented in the manuscript with closed eyes and other people writing.  The caption, not shown here, of that miniature refers to him as "Herr" (then spelled "Her") Reinmar, implying that he was a knight and that he became blind (if he was blind) in adulthood.
