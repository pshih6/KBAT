Fredrik Larsson (born 14 August 1974) is the current bass guitarist of the Swedish power metal band HammerFall, which he left in 1997, but rejoined in 2007. He also provides backing vocals with HammerFall.
He has played, and sometimes recorded, with several death metal bands and in 2007 was asked by the band Evergrey to be their bass guitarist. Larsson did join Evergrey, but left fairly shortly after, to rejoin HammerFall who were without a bass player following Magnus Ros√©n's departure. Larsson finished his promised work with Evergrey before rejoining HammerFall.
