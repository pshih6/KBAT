Andrew James Breitbart (; February 1, 1969 â€“ March 1, 2012) was an American conservative journalist, writer, and commentator who was the founder of Breitbart News.
After helping in the early stages of HuffPost and the Drudge Report, Breitbart created Breitbart News, a news and right-wing opinion website, along with multiple other "BIG" sites - BIGHollywood, BIGGovernment, BIGJournalism. He played central roles in the Anthony Weiner sexting scandal, the firing of Shirley Sherrod, and the ACORN 2009 undercover videos controversy. Commenters such as Nick Gillespie and Conor Friedersdorf have credited Breitbart with changing how people wrote about politics by "show[ing] how the Internet could be used to route around information bottlenecks imposed by official spokesmen and legacy news outlets" .
