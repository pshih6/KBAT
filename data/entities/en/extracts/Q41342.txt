Mary Tyler Moore (December 29, 1936 – January 25, 2017) was an American stage, film, and television actress, as well as a producer and social advocate. She was widely known for her prominent television sitcom roles in The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961–1966) and The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970–1977).Her film work included 1967's Thoroughly Modern Millie and 1980's Ordinary People, the latter earning Moore a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Moore was an advocate for animal rights, vegetarianism and diabetes prevention.
With her two most prominent roles challenging gender stereotypes and norms, The New York Times said Moore's "performances on [The Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show] helped define a new vision of American womanhood." The Guardian said "her outwardly bubbly personality and trademark broad, toothy smile disguised an inner fragility that appealed to an audience facing the new trials of modern-day existence."
