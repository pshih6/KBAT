Robert H. Scanlan (1914-2001) was a civil and aeronautical engineer who came to be widely recognized as a leader in the analysis of wind effects on large structures. Scanlan created the concept of flutter derivatives to aid in the representation of self-excited forces in theoretical models. His research in the area of bridge aerodynamics made possible the construction of larger, sturdier, and more cost-effective bridges. Scanlan worked in both industry and academia, and his employers included Republic Aviation, the Federal Aviation Administration, the French agencies CNRS and ONERA, Schlumberger, the Case Institute of Technology, Princeton University, and Johns Hopkins University. In the course of his life, Scanlan published two textbooks, "Aircraft Vibration and Flutter" and "Wind Effects on Large Structures," which are used by engineers worldwide.
