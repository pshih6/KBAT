The Social Democratic Party of Austria (German: Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs, SPÖ) is a social-democratic political party in Austria. The oldest extant political party in Austria, the SPÖ is a member of the Socialist International, Progressive Alliance, and Party of European Socialists. Before adopting the current title in 1991, the SPÖ was named Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria (Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Österreichs, SDAPÖ) from 1888 to 1945 and, later, Socialist Party of Austria (Sozialistische Partei Österreichs) until 1991. Along with the Austrian People's Party, it is one of the country's two traditional major parties.
The SPÖ has close ties to the Austrian Trade Union Federation (ÖGB) and the Austrian Chamber of Labour (AK). Currently the second-largest party in both chambers of Parliament; the National Council and the Federal Council, the SPÖ forms the main opposition party to the federal government, a coalition of the People's Party (ÖVP) and the Greens.
