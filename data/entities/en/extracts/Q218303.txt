The Independence Party (Icelandic: Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn) is a liberal-conservative, Eurosceptic political party in Iceland. It is currently the largest party in the Alþingi, with 16 seats. The chairman of the party is Bjarni Benediktsson. The secretary of the party is Áslaug Arna Sigurbjörnsdóttir.
It was formed in 1929 through a merger of the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party. This united the two parties advocating the dissolution of the Union of Denmark and Iceland; dissolution was achieved in 1944, during the German occupation of Denmark. From 1929, the party won the largest share of the vote in every election until the 2009 election, when it fell behind the Social Democratic Alliance. Until Bjarni took the leadership after the 2009 defeat, every Independence Party leader has also held the office of Prime Minister. Since 2013, the Independence Party has joined the coalition government.
The Independence Party broadly encompasses all centre-right thought in Iceland. Economically liberal and opposed to interventionism, the party is supported most strongly by fishermen and high-earners, particularly in Reykjavík. It supports Icelandic membership of NATO but opposes the idea of joining the European Union (EU). It is a member of the International Democrat Union, and it joined the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists (AECR) in November 2011, a centre-right Eurosceptic European political party.
