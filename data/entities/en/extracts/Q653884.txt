Hispanic America (Spanish: Hispanoamérica or América Hispana), also known as Spanish America (Spanish: América española), is the portion of the Americas comprising the Spanish-speaking countries of the continents of North and South America.These countries and Spain have significant commonalities with one another as all were part of the same state and the society it created. In all of these countries, Spanish is the main language, sometimes sharing official status with one or more indigenous languages (such as Guaraní, Quechua, Aymara, or Mayan), or English (in Puerto Rico) and Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion.Hispanic America is sometimes grouped together with Brazil under the term "Ibero-America", meaning those countries in the Americas with cultural roots in the Iberian Peninsula. Hispanic America also contrasts with Latin America, which includes not only Hispanic America, but also Brazil (the former Portuguese America, several colonies and dependencies of Portuguese Empire of Portugal across center-east, northern, northeastern and southeastern South America that came together to form the independent Brazil in the 19th century), as well as the former French colonies in the Western Hemisphere (areas that are now in either the United States of America or Canada are usually excluded).
