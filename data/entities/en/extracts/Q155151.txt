Georges Henri Yvon Joseph Ruggiu (born October 12, 1957, in Verviers, Belgium) was a presenter on the Rwandan radio station Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, which played a significant role in promoting the genocide against the Tutsi.  Like the station's other broadcasters, Ruggiu incited violence against Tutsi and moderate Hutu over the air. Ruggiu eventually pleaded guilty to charges of incitement to commit genocide and in 2000 was sentenced to 12 years in prison by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  An Italian-Belgian who became involved in Rwandan politics two years before the genocide, Ruggiu was the only non-Rwandan charged with involvement in the genocide.
