À toi de faire... mignonne (Italian: L'agente federale Lemmy Caution), released in the US as Your Turn, Darling, is a French-Italian film based on the novels of Peter Cheyney. It came out ten years after La môme vert-de-gris which had been the first of film of this series.
It was shot at the Billancourt Studios in Paris and on location around the city. The film's sets were designed by the art director René Moulaert.
For the last time Bernard Borderie directed the popular actor Eddie Constantine in a Lemmy Caution adventure.
Guy Delorme, who in 1961 had been the Comte de Rochefort in Borderie's classic film version of The Three Musketeers, acts another time as a scheming bad guy.
