Pulse (stylised as P•U•L•S•E) is a Pink Floyd concert video taken from the 20 October 1994 concert at Earls Court, London, England in The Division Bell Tour. It was originally released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1995.
There was considerable delay in the release of the DVD edition of Pulse, with new features announced with each setback. The cause of the delays was reputed to be the continued modifications and additions to produce a high-quality release. The previous planned release date of 22 September 2005 for the two-disc DVD set was changed to 10 July 2006 for the UK and Europe, and 11 July 2006 everywhere else.
