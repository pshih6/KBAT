Sadiki College, also known as Collège Sadiki (Tunisian Arabic: المدرسة الصادقية‎, "El-Sadqiya High School"), is a lycée (high school) in Tunis, Tunisia. It was established in 1875. Associations formed by its alumni played a major role in the early constitutionalist movement in the country.Noted alumni include ex-President Habib Bourguiba, politicians Mohamed Mzali  and Mustapha Ben Jafar. Another alumnus was the creative writer Mahmoud Messadi.Sadiki historically has provided a bicultural, bilingual education. Many of the Tunisian elites, including Bourguiba, graduated from this school. These elites filled the positions of top responsibility of the Destour party. Charles A. Micaud of The Western Political Quarterly said "[i]ts realistic strategy of struggle against colonialism became convincing even to Zitūna students, many of whom came to form the medium and lower cadres of the party." The graduates of Sadiki placed a bilingual education system in Tunisia after its independence.
