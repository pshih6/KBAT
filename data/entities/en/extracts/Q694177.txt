E Nomine (from the Latin In Nomine, "In The Name Of") is a German musical project, formed in 1999, by producers Christian Weller and Friedrich "Fritz" Graner. Their music, which they call monumental vocal style, is a combination of trance, techno, and vocals which closely resemble Gregorian singing and chanting. Other vocals are performed by German voice actors such as long-time collaborators Christian Br√ºckner and Rolf Schult. The primary languages in the songs are German and Latin.The project released its first album, Das Testament, in 1999. It was followed by Finsternis in 2002, Die Prophezeiung in 2003 and a compilation in 2004 (Das Beste aus... Gottes Beitrag und Teufels Werk), which also included new songs. No further official releases followed, but the project never officially ended. Two unreleased songs, Heilig and Excalibur, became public under various circumstances.
In 2008, the founders of E Nomine Weller and Graner started a new project, Schlafes Bruder. Their first album includes both of the unreleased songs that originated from the E Nomine project.
E Nomine's Christian-themed song "Vater Unser" (Our Father) and album Das Testament were very popular among the German public.
