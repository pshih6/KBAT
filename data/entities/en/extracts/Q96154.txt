Ferdinand Friedrich Zimmermann (August 14, 1898 â€“ July 11, 1967) was a German author. He used his pseudonym of Ferdinand Fried to publish.
Zimmermann was born in Bad Freienwalde, studied economics and philosophy at Berlin, and worked for the newspapers Vossische Zeitung and Berliner Morgenpost before joining the magazine Die Tat in 1931. A supporter of Nazism he joined the Schutzstaffel in 1934 and the Nazi Party itself in 1936. During the War, he worked at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague. After the War, he found work at the Sonntagsblatt and Die Welt newspapers.
In 1931 he published the book Das Ende des Kapitalismus (The End of Capitalism), in which he offered the view that laissez-faire capitalism was dead, and that German autarky was the future.
