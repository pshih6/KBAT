Huber joined the Nazi Party in 1937 and worked closely with Gestapo chief Heinrich Müller. After the annexation of Austria in 1938, Huber was posted to Vienna, where he was appointed chief of the Security Police (SiPo) and Gestapo for Vienna, the "Lower Danube" and "Upper Danube" regions. He was responsible for mass deportations of Jews from the area. After the war ended, Huber never served any prison time and died in Munich in 1975.
