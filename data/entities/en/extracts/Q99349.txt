Wilhelm Dreher (10 January 1892 in Ay an der Iller, Neu-Ulm district – 19 November 1969 in Senden) was a German politician with the Nazi Party.
Dreher was a member of the Reichstag, first being elected in 1928 and retaining his seat until the fall of the Third Reich. In the early 1930s he was close to Gregor Strasser for a time. He was recognised within the Nazi Party as an economics specialist and he wrote on this topic for Völkischer Beobachter.
In 1933 he became the Polizeidirektor in Ulm, and an Oberführer in the SS.
