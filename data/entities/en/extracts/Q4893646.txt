Bernard Charles "Barry" Sherman,  (February 25, 1942 â€“ December 13, 2017) was a Canadian businessman and philanthropist who was chairman and CEO of Apotex Inc. With an estimated net worth of US$3.2 billion at the time of his death, according to Forbes, Sherman was the 12th-wealthiest Canadian. Another publication, Canadian Business, stated his fortune at CAN$4.77 billion, ranking him the 15th richest in Canada.Sherman, a University of Toronto graduate with a doctorate in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, got his start in the pharmaceutical business in the 1960s, when the estate of his uncle Louis Lloyd Winter let him run Empire Laboratories, the late uncle's drug company. This eventually led Sherman to form Apotex, where he earned a reputation among both competitors and government regulators for extreme combativeness, often including litigation. His four cousins, who were supposed to have received 5 percent stakes in Empire, later sued Sherman unsuccessfully over his sale of Empire.
In 1971 he married his wife Honey, who would later rise to prominence in Canadian philanthropy, serving on the boards of several prominent charities. The two were found slain in their home late in 2017 by unknown assailants, according to the Toronto Police, who are investigating the case. As of April 2019, the police said they had a "working theory" of the case, and an "idea of what happened."
