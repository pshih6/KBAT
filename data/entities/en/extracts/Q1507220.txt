George Dewey Clyde (July 21, 1898 â€“ April 2, 1972) was an American politician and the tenth Governor of Utah, serving two terms from 1957 until 1965 as a Republican.
Although Clyde was on the faculty of Utah State University for twenty two years, serving as Dean of the agricultural college's College of Engineering and Technology, he is best known for an eight-year battle with Utah school teachers that eventually resulted in the first statewide teachers strike in United States history during May 1964. He was also involved in the creation of Canyonlands National Park. He came from a prominent Latter-day Saint family in Springville, south of Provo, Utah. Clyde was the younger brother of W. W. Clyde, wealthy philanthropist and founder of W.W. Clyde Company and Geneva Rock.
Clyde received his bachelor's degree from Utah State University and a master's degree from the University of California, Berkeley.
