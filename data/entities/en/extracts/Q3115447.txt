Granville Tailer Woods (April 23, 1856 â€“ January 30, 1910) was an inventor who held more than 60 patents in the U.S. He was the first American of African ancestry to be a mechanical and electrical engineer after the Civil War.  Self-taught, he concentrated most of his work on trains and streetcars.  One of his notable inventions was a device he called the Synchronous Multiplex Railway Telegraph, a variation of induction telegraph which relied on ambient static electricity from existing telegraph lines to send messages between train stations and moving trains. His work assured a safer and better public transportation system for the cities of the United States.
