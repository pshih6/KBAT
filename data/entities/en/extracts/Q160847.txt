Hideki Tojo (December 30, 1884 â€“ December 23, 1948) was a Japanese politician and general of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) who served as Prime Minister of Japan and President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association for the majority of World War II. Before becoming Japan's head of government, Tojo was among the most outspoken proponents for preventive war against the United States during deliberations leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Upon becoming Prime Minister in October 17, 1941, he presided over the conquest of much of the West's territories in Asia and the Pacific until the defeat of Japanese forces at Midway and Guadalcanal. During his years in power, he also oversaw the perpetration of numerous war crimes including the systematic massacre and starvation of civilians and prisoners of war. As the war's tide increasingly turned against Japan, Tojo was forced to resign as Prime Minister on July 22, 1944. After Japan's surrender in September 1945, Tojo was arrested, convicted by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, sentenced to death, and hanged on December 23, 1948.
