William Sumio Naito (September 16, 1925 â€“ May 8, 1996) was a noted businessman, civic leader and philanthropist in Portland, Oregon, U.S.  He was an enthusiastic advocate for investment in downtown Portland, both private and public, and is widely credited for helping to reverse a decline in the area in the 1970s through acquiring and renovating derelict or aging buildings and encouraging others to invest in downtown and the central city.In the 1980s and 1990s he was one of Portland's most esteemed business and civic leaders, honored with "dozens" of awards and holding positions on several volunteer boards, commissions, and advisory committees.  He commonly went by the name Bill, as opposed to William. An arterial street in downtown Portland, Front Avenue, was renamed Naito Parkway in his honor.
