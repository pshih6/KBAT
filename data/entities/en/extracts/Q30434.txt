The Dôme du Goûter (4,304 m) is a mountain in the Mont Blanc massif. It is a shoulder of Mont Blanc, whose summit lies two kilometres to the south-east. The Dôme is traversed on ascents of Mont Blanc via the Bosses route.
The summit of the Dôme is marked as lying entirely within France on the French Institut Géographique National (IGN) map [2], although on Italian Istituto Geografico Militare (IGM) map [3] the summit appears to lie on the frontier between France and Italy. In June 2015, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi expressed repeated claims on the territory.
