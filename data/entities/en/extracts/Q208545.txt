The Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Serbo-Croatian: Socijalistička Republika Bosna i Hercegovina / Социјалистичка Pепублика Босна и Херцеговина), commonly referred to as Socialist Bosnia or simply Bosnia, was one of the six constituent federal states forming the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It was a predecessor of the modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, existing between 1945 and 1992. It was subsequently given the higher status of a Socialist Republic, under strict terms of consociationalism known as "ethnic key" (Bosnian: nacionalni ključ), based on the balance in the political representation of ethnic groups (Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks). The capital city was Sarajevo, which remained the capital following independence. The Socialist Republic was dissolved in 1990 when it abandoned its socialist institutions and adopted liberal ones, as the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina which declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina was, up to 20 December 1990, in the hands of the League of Communists of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The borders of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina were almost identical to the ones Bosnia had during the period of Austro-Hungarian rule that lasted until 1918.  That year Bosnia became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and during that period the territory was divided among banovinas. When SR Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed, it included what were the territories of most of Vrbas Banovina, the western part of Drina Banovina, the northwestern part of Zeta Banovina, and the eastern parts of Banovina of Croatia.
