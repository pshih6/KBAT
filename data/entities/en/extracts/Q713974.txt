Josef Daniel Stenbäck (May 2, 1854, Alavus — April 27, 1929, Helsinki) was a Finnish church architect and engineer. He designed 35 churches for Finland, which until 1917 was part of the Russian Empire. Four of the churches were located in the current Russian territory of the Karelian Isthmus, ceded to the Soviet Union in 1944. Stenbäck's churches represent Romantic nationalism or Gothic Revival. One of his most famous works is the Juselius Mausoleum.
