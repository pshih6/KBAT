L'Ile Mysterieuse / La Isla misteriosa y el capitán Nemo / Die Geheimnisvolle Insel (The Mysterious Island) is a 1973 European  film (96 minutes) adapted from Jules Verne's novel L'Île mystérieuse. This version was directed by Juan Antonio Bardem and Henri Colpi and featured Omar Sharif as Captain Nemo.
It was a recut from a TV series of the same year.
It turned out to be one of the most remarkable Jules Verne adaptations for remaining unusually faithful to the original book, including the exterior design of the Nautilus.
Deviations from the original book were either limited to budget restrictions or moderate artistic liberty: While it seems not credible that the Nemo of the book achieved various, physically demanding stunts (considering he was weakened and subsequently dying of old age), Omar Sharif is much younger, relies on what's left of his crew (killed by some kind of disease, most likely radiation poisoning) and eventually shares the same fate as his alter ego James Mason in the Disney version of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.
