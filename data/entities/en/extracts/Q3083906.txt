François Barthélemy Arlès-Dufour (3 June 1797 – 21 January 1872) was a French silk merchant and leading exponent of Saint-Simonianism.
He was born to a poor family, had little formal education and began work in a shawl factory at the age of 16.
Later he joined a silk company based in Liepzig, Germany, married into the owners' family and was placed in charge of its Lyon operations.
Working first for his in-laws and then independently, he made a fortune in silk.
Arlès-Dufour also became involved in banking, railways and the Suez canal project.
He played an important role in the Lyon Chamber of Commerce, and as a member of the jury in various international expositions.
He believed in free trade and in social institutions that would help the most disadvantaged social classes.
