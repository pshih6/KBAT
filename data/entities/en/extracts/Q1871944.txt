Samuel Insull (November 11, 1859 â€“ July 16, 1938) was a British-born American business magnate. He was an innovator and investor based in Chicago who greatly contributed to creating an integrated electrical infrastructure in the United States. Insull created holding companies that purchased utilities and railroads.  He was also responsible for the building of the Chicago Civic Opera House in 1929. 
In the Great Depression, his vast Midwest holding company empire collapsed, and he was accused of profiting personally by selling worthless stock to unsuspecting investors who trusted him because of his position and reputation. Following a seven-week trial, he and 16 co-defendants were acquitted of all charges after only two hours of jury deliberation.
