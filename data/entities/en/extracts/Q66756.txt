Gustav Otto (12 January 1883 â€“ 28 February 1926) was a German aircraft and aircraft engine designer and manufacturer.
Gustav was born in Cologne to Nikolaus August Otto, the founder of N. A. Otto & Cie. and inventor of the four-stroke internal combustion engine. It is therefore regarded that his interest in engines, specifically aircraft and the manufacture thereof, was something he inherited from his father at an early age.
