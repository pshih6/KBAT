Fausto de Elhuyar (11 October 1755 – 6 February 1833) was a Spanish chemist, and the joint discoverer of tungsten with his brother Juan José Elhuyar in 1783. He was in charge, under a King of Spain commission, of organizing the School of Mines in México City and so was responsible for building an architectural jewel known as the "Palacio de Minería".  Elhuyar left Mexico after the Mexican War of Independence, when most of the Spanish residents in Mexico were expelled.
