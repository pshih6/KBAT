The Dark Side of the Sun is a 1988 American-Yugoslavian drama film directed by Božidar Nikolić and stars Brad Pitt in his first leading role as a young man in search of a cure for a dreaded skin disease.
Director Božidar Nikolić picked Brad Pitt out of 400 candidates for the main role. Brad Pitt was very happy for the pick and was only paid $1523 for seven weeks of filming in 1988. Nikolic said that film was then shelved due to lack of entertainment value. The movie was released directly-to-video in 1997.
