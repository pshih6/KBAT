Edmund John Philip Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley, FRS, FREng, FGS, FInstP, HonFRSC, HonFIMechE, HonFIChemE, CIMgt, FInstPet, FIMMM (born 20 February 1948) is a British businessman.
He is best known for his role as the chief executive of the energy company BP between 1995 and 2007. This period has been described as the company's "golden period of expansion and diversification" though an investigation of the fatal explosion at BP's Texas City, Texas, plant on 23 March 2005 that killed 15 workers and injured more than 170 others, resulted in fines and awards being given out for breaches in its health and safety regime.
Browne was lauded during this period, as he engineered a merger with rival Amoco, and gained access to Russian oil reserves with the creation of TNK-BP. Nicknamed by employees the "Sun King" for his management style, he was also praised for increasing BP's interest in renewable energy sources. He resigned from BP in May 2007 in controversial circumstances surrounding his personal life.
He is a former President of the Royal Academy of Engineering (2006 to July 2011). Since 2001, he has been a crossbench member of the House of Lords. Lord Browne is a former Partner of Riverstone, which is co-owner of Cuadrilla resources. He received his undergraduate education at the University of Cambridge and later attended Stanford University.
