Oakes Ames (January 10, 1804 â€“ May 8, 1873) was an American businessman, investor, and politician. He was a member of the United States House of Representatives from Massachusetts.  As a congressman, he is credited by many historians as being the single most important influence in the building of the Union Pacific portion of the transcontinental railroad. He is also noted for the subsequent scandal that alleged the improper sale of stock of the railroad's construction company.
