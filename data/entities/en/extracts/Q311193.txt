Yoshiki Hayashi (林 佳樹, Hayashi Yoshiki, born November 20, 1965), known by the mononym Yoshiki, is a Japanese musician, songwriter, composer and record producer. He is best known as a co-founder of the visual kei rock band X Japan, for which he is the drummer, pianist and main songwriter. Yoshiki's solo career includes two classical studio albums—Eternal Melody (1993), produced by George Martin, and Eternal Melody II (2005)—and the classical compilation Yoshiki Classical (2013). Described by Billboard as a "musical innovator" and named "one of the most influential composers in Japanese history" by Consequence of Sound, Yoshiki has also collaborated and played with artists such as Bono, will.i.am, Jennifer Hudson, Tetsuya Komuro, Roger Taylor, Gene Simmons, and Sarah Brightman.
In 1999, at the request of the Japanese government, he composed and performed a classical song at a celebration in honor of the tenth anniversary of Emperor Akihito's enthronement. For the 69th Golden Globe Awards, the show's original musical theme was composed by Yoshiki and became available for digital download on iTunes, with all proceeds going to charity.
