Broadcast are an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1995 by Trish Keenan (vocals, keyboards, guitar) and James Cargill (bass). Their musical style blends elements of 1960s American psychedelia with experimental electronica, incorporating samples from various sources, and earned the band a cult following.Broadcast have released three studio albums—The Noise Made by People (2000), Haha Sound (2003), and Tender Buttons (2005)—as well as several EPs and a collaboration album with the Focus Group titled Broadcast and The Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age (2009). Their most recent release is the soundtrack album Berberian Sound Studio (2013).
Aside from founding members Keenan and Cargill, Broadcast has experienced regular lineup changes. The band has included Roj Stevens (keyboards), Tim Felton (guitar), and Steve Perkins (drums). Keith York, Phil Jenkins, Jeremy Barnes and Neil Bullock have also featured in the band as drummers. As of 2005, Broadcast consisted only of the founding duo. Following the death of Keenan in 2011, Cargill remained the only member.
