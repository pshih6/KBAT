Henry Edwards Huntington (February 27, 1850 â€“ May 23, 1927) was an American railroad magnate and collector of art and rare books.  Huntington settled in Los Angeles, where he owned the Pacific Electric Railway as well as substantial real estate interests.  In addition to being a businessman and art collector, Huntington was a major booster for Los Angeles in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the city of San Marino, California, many places are named after him, including a school, a road and a library.
