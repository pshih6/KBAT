Robert L. Turner (born May 2, 1941) is an American businessman and politician who served as the United States Representative for New York's 9th congressional district, in the United States' 112th Congress (containing parts of Brooklyn and Queens), from 2011 to 2013. He is a member of the Republican Party. Turner was elected in September 2011 to complete the term of Democrat Anthony Weiner, who had resigned following allegations of improper behavior.
Turner had been a media executive known for his success in the television talk show segment of the industry. Six years after retiring from his business career, he entered politics to run against Weiner in the November 2010 election—losing, receiving 39 percent of the vote. Less than one year later, he defeated Democrat David Weprin 52–47 in the special election battle for Weiner's seat—becoming the first Republican to represent the area since 1923. In 2012, after his district was eliminated in redistricting, Turner ran for the United States Senate, but was defeated in the primaries. Turner was named chairman of the Queens County chapter of the Republican Party in 2015. He was ousted as chairman in 2017.
