Mephisto is a 1981 drama film based on the novel of the same title by Klaus Mann. Directed by István Szabó, produced by Manfred Durniok and screenplay written by Péter Dobai and Szabó, Mephisto follows a German stage actor which finds unexpected success and mixed blessings in the popularity of his performance in a Faustian play as the Nazis take power in pre-WWII Germany. As his associates and friends flee or are ground under by the Nazi terror, the popularity of his character supersedes his own existence until he finds that his best performance is keeping up appearances for his Nazi patrons. The film stars Klaus Maria Brandauer as the main role, alongside Krystyna Janda and Ildiko Bansagi in supporting roles.
Mephisto was released on April 29, 1981 in Germany and on October 8, 1981 in Hungary. The film received generally positive reviews and was the first Hungarian film to win an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film.
