Charles Magnette (French: [maɲɛt]; 3 February 1863 – 18 October 1937), was a Belgian lawyer and a liberal politician.
He was President of the Belgian Senate from 1928 until 1932 and Minister of State. He was Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Belgium three times. Charles Magnette was the founder of the International Masonic Association in 1921.
In 1914 and 1916 he appealed to the German Grand Lodges, complaining about the atrocities which were committed by the Germans, who occupied most part of Belgium during World War I, and the deportation of workers. As a result, he served a prison sentence. A street in Liege is named after him.
