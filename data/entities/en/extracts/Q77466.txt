Arthur Moeller van den Bruck (23 April 1876 â€“ 30 May 1925) was a German cultural historian and writer, best known for his controversial 1923 book Das Dritte Reich (The Third Reich), which promoted German nationalism and was a strong influence on the Conservative Revolutionary movement and later the Nazi Party.
From 1906 to 1922, he also published Elisabeth Kaerrick's first full German translation of Dostoyevsky's works.
