The Los Angeles Rams are a professional American football team based in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The Rams compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the National Football Conference (NFC) West division. The club has won three NFL championships, and is the only one to win championships representing three cities (Cleveland in 1945, Los Angeles in 1951, and St. Louis in 1999). Starting in 2020, the Rams will play their home games at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, which they will share with the Los Angeles Chargers.
The franchise began in 1936 as the Cleveland Rams, based in Cleveland, Ohio. The club was owned by Homer Marshman and featured players such as William "Bud" Cooper, Harry "The Horse" Mattos, Stan Pincura, and Mike Sebastian. Damon "Buzz" Wetzel joined as general manager.The franchise relocated to Los Angeles in 1946 following the 1945 NFL Championship Game victory, making way for Paul Brown's Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference and becoming the only NFL championship team to play the following season in another city. The club played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before moving into a reconstructed Anaheim Stadium in Orange County, California in 1980.
The Rams left southern California and moved to St. Louis, Missouri, following the 1994 NFL season. Five seasons after relocating, the team won Super Bowl XXXIV in a 23–16 victory over the Tennessee Titans. The club then played in Super Bowl XXXVI, where they lost 20–17 to the New England Patriots. The Rams played in St. Louis until the end of the 2015 NFL season, when they filed notice with the NFL of their intent to relocate back to Los Angeles. The club's request to move was approved at an owners' meeting in January 2016, and the Rams returned to the city for the 2016 NFL season.
The Rams appeared in Super Bowl LIII, where they lost to the New England Patriots 13–3 in a rematch of Super Bowl XXXVI.
