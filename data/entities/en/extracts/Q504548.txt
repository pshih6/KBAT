Milton "Gummo" Marx (October 23, 1893 â€“ April 21, 1977) was an American vaudevillian performer, actor, comedian and theatrical agent. He was the second youngest of the five Marx Brothers. Born in Manhattan, New York City, he worked with his brothers on the vaudeville circuit, leaving the act when he was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1918, during World War I (years before his brothers, Chico, Harpo, Groucho, and Zeppo, began their film careers).
