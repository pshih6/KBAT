He served as a town councilor for sometime after the war and aided in restoration efforts though died before an election as a Christian Democrat candidate in an accident.Marvelli's reputation for holiness and for his faith led to the cause for his beatification being introduced and Pope John Paul II beatified Marvelli in 2004 in Loreto.
