Abbé Nicolas Delsor (5 October 1847 – 20 December 1927) was a French priest and politician. He represented Bas Rhin in the German Reichstag before World War I, and then in the French Senate after the war. Although born French, his primary allegiance was to the Catholic church, and he drew criticism for cooperating with the German authorities after Alsace was annexed in 1871.
