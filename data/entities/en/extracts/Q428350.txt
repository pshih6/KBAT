The White, the Yellow, and the Black (Italian: Il bianco, il giallo, il nero), also known as Samurai and Shoot First... Ask Questions Later, is a 1975 Spaghetti Western comedy film.
It is the last spaghetti western directed by Sergio Corbucci. Differently from his previous western films, this is openly parodic, acting as a spoof of Red Sun. It was generally poorly received by critics. The character of Milian will be reprised by the same actor, with slight changes, in the comedy film Delitto al ristorante cinese.
