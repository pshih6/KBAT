Maxime Weygand (French pronunciation: ​[vɛɡɑ̃]; 21 January 1867 – 28 January 1965) was a French military commander in World War I and World War II.
Weygand mainly served as a staff officer to Ferdinand Foch in World War I. Weygand initially fought against the Germans during the invasion of France in 1940, but then signed an armistice with and partially collaborated with the Germans as part of the Vichy France regime before being arrested by the Germans for not fully collaborating with them.
