The University of Pécs (PTE; Hungarian: Pécsi Tudományegyetem) is one of the major institutions of higher education in Hungary. Although the year 1367 appears in the seal of the university, it is not a successor of the medieval university founded in Pécs in 1367 by Louis I of Hungary. More than 20,000 students presently attend the University of Pécs, approximately 4,000 of whom are international students studying in English or German.
