Michael Avery Ross (born August 2, 1961) is an American businessman and politician. He is a member of the Democratic Party who was his party's 2014 nominee for Governor of Arkansas. He also served as the U.S. Representative for Arkansas's 4th congressional district from 2001 to 2013. He was also a member of the Arkansas Senate from 1991 to 2001, member of the Nevada County Quorum Court from 1983 to 1985, and is a former small business owner.
On July 25, 2011, Ross announced that he would not seek re-election to the House in 2012. He instead became the Democratic nominee for governor of Arkansas in the general election scheduled for November 4, 2014. He faced the Republican choice, former U.S. Representative Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas's 3rd congressional district and the 2006 failed nominee against outgoing Governor Mike Beebe, a Democrat. Ross lost to Hutchinson in the general election which effectively ended his undefeated streak.
He presently serves as an officer and senior vice president at Little Rock-based Southwest Power Pool, which manages the electric grid and operates the wholesale electric market for all or parts of 14 states.
