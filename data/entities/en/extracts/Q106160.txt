Wilhelm Kunst (2 February 1799 in Hamburg - 16 or 17 November 1859 in Vienna) was a celebrated German actor who provoked quite varied opinions. He was born to play heroic rolls, but some thought, due to lack of study, or perhaps too much of the comedian's touch, Kunst did not do well in roles that required subtlety and excellence in acting. He did better in lower-rated versions of a particular plot, for example being suited to lesser translations of Shakespeare rather than first-rate ones; but in the plays he excelled at, for example Otto von Wittelsbach, he was quite stunning. He first played major roles in Lübeck and worked his way up to the Viennese stage. During his heyday, he did quite well economically, but ended his career in poverty. In 1825, he married the actress Sophie Schröder.
