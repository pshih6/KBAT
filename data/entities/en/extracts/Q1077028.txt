Chris Brokaw (born August 1, 1964) is an American musician, mostly known for his work with the bands Come and Codeine, in addition to his many collaborations and original soundtracks. His outlier, underground status, in addition to his constant touring, abundant collaborative projects, and prolific musical output, have resulted in Brokaw being repeatedly described as 'one of the hardest-working musicians in anti-show-business.'
