Habsburg Netherlands (Dutch: Habsburgse Nederlanden; French: Pays-Bas des Habsbourg), also referred to as Belgica or Flanders, is the collective name of Holy Roman Empire fiefs in the Low Countries held by the House of Habsburg. The rule began in 1482, when the last Valois-Burgundy ruler of the Netherlands, Mary, married Maximilian I of Austria. Their grandson, Emperor Charles V, was born in the Habsburg Netherlands and made Brussels one of his capitals.Becoming the Seventeen Provinces in 1549, they were held by the Spanish branch of the Habsburgs within the Spanish Empire from 1556, and are therefore also known as the Spanish Netherlands from that time on. In 1581, the Seven United Provinces started a secession war that to form the Dutch Republic; the remaining Spanish Southern Netherlands became the Austrian Netherlands in 1714 and were annexed by the French First Republic in 1795.
