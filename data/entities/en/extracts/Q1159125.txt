Daniel Miller (born May 30, 1942) is an American Republican politician from the state of Florida. He represented the state and its 13th district in the House of Representatives for ten years. After he vacated his House seat, Katherine Harris was elected to represent the district in 2002.
Miller was born in Highland Park, Michigan, but moved to Florida during his childhood and graduated from Manatee High School in Bradenton, Florida, in 1960. He was an undergraduate at the University of Florida, Gainesville, and received his MBA from Emory University. He then got his Ph.D. and served as a professor at several colleges across the South.  He also developed a successful business career, working with his father Don Sr. and brother Don Jr. on a restaurant, nursing home and real estate development.  In 1992, Miller decided to run for Congress after the incumbent Andy Ireland stepped down.
Miller was elected to the U.S. House in 1992, and served for the following ten years.  He decided not to run for re-election in 2002, honoring his self-imposed term limit of 10 years.
In Congress, Miller advocated spending restraint as a fiscal conservative.  He served on several committees during his tenure, including Appropriations, Government Reform & Oversight, and Budget.  Miller championed Medicare reform, fought to end the costly sugar subsidy, and opposed earmarking.  Miller also served as chairman of the subcommittee on the United States Census, overseeing the 2000 decennial census, a position he was uniquely qualified to hold as a former statistics professor.
Miller was with President George W. Bush visiting Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota on the morning of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
