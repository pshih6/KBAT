She was known for her portrayal of the sarcastic and quick-witted senior citizen Sophia Petrillo on The Golden Girls (1985 – 1992), a role she reprised for appearances on Empty Nest (1993 – 1995), The Golden Palace (1992 – 1993), Blossom (1990–1995), and Nurses (1991 – 1994). Other notable films in which she appeared include Mask (1985), a semi-biographical film in which she played the grandmother of Roy L. Dennis, and Stuart Little (1999). She retired from acting in the early 2000s, due to issues with her health.
