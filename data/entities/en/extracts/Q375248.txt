Cutie Honey (キューティーハニー, Kyūtī Hanī) is a 2004 Japanese tokusatsu film directed by Hideaki Anno. It is an adaptation of the 1970s manga and anime series Cutie Honey.
The film stars popular Japanese model Eriko Sato as the hyperactive Honey. The film loosely retells the classic story of Cutie Honey's battle to defend humanity and avenge her father against Panther Claw. In this version, Honey's powers come from the Imaginary Induction System. Called I-system for short, the name is a pun on the word "love" (愛, ai). Villains Honey faces include Sister Jill, Gold Claw, Cobalt Claw, Scarlet Claw, and Black Claw. The film also features a cameo by series creator Go Nagai.
Cutie Honey was followed two months later by an OVA series, Re: Cutie Honey, based on the film. In North America, the film was released direct-to-DVD on April 17, 2007 by Bandai Entertainment. Previously, the 1994 New Cutie Honey OVA was the only incarnation of Cutie Honey to have been commercially released in the United States.
