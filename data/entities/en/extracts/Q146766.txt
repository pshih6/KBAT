Dulwich ( DUL-itch) is an area of south London, England. The settlement is mostly in the London Borough of Southwark, with parts in the London Borough of Lambeth, and consists of Dulwich Village, East Dulwich, West Dulwich and the Southwark half of Herne Hill (which is often referred to as the North Dulwich triangle). Dulwich lies in a valley between the neighbouring districts of Camberwell (to the west), Crystal Palace, Denmark Hill, Forest Hill, Peckham, Sydenham Hill and Tulse Hill.
Dulwich formed part of the ancient parish of Camberwell in Surrey. The parish became the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell within the County of London in 1889. In 1965, the borough was abolished and the area became part of the newly-created London Borough of Southwark.
