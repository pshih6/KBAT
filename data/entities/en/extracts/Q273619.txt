The Polytechnique Montréal (French pronunciation: ​[pɔlitɛknik mɔ̃ʁeal]) (previously École Polytechnique de Montréal; French pronunciation: ​[ekɔl pɔlitɛknik də mɔ̃ʁeal]) is an engineering school affiliated with the Université de Montréal in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It ranks first in Canada for the scope of its engineering research. It is occasionally referred to as Montreal Polytechnic, although in Quebec English its French name is more commonly used.  The school offers graduate and postgraduate training, and is very active in research.  Following tradition, new Bachelors of Engineering (B.Eng) graduating from the École Polytechnique receive an Iron Ring, during the Canadian Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer ceremony.
