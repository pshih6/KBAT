Georges Eugène Benjamin Clemenceau (, also US: , French: [ʒɔʁʒ bɛ̃ʒamɛ̃ klemɑ̃so]; 28 September 1841 – 24 November 1929) was a French statesman who served as Prime Minister of France during World War I. A leading figure of the Independent Radicals, he played a central role in the politics of the Third Republic.
Clemenceau was Prime Minister of France from 1906 to 1909 and from 1917 to 1920. Demanding a total victory over Germany, he wanted reparations, colonies, Alsace-Lorraine, and strict rules to prevent Germany from rearming.  He achieved these goals in the Treaty of Versailles imposed on Germany at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. Nicknamed "Père la Victoire" (Father Victory) or "Le Tigre" (The Tiger), in the 1920s he continued his harsh position against Germany, though not quite as much as the President Raymond Poincaré.  He obtained mutual defense treaties with Britain and the United States, to unite against German aggression, but these never took effect.
