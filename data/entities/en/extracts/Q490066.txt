Angermünde (German pronunciation: [aŋɐˈmʏndə] (listen)) is a town in the district of Uckermark in the state of Brandenburg, Germany. It is about 43 miles (69 km) northeast of Berlin, the capital of Germany.
The population is about 10,000, but the population has been rapidly falling as its traditional industrial base (enamel-working) has declined. An administrative sub-centre of its district, it has several Protestant churches, a former Franciscan church, a number of schools of higher learning and a recently refurbished historic marketplace with an old town hall. Located in the game-filled forests of the Uckermark, with its many lakes, it now relies heavily on tourism and the sources of revenue linked to it.
