Agostino Scilla (10 August 1629 â€“ 31 May 1700) was an Italian Baroque painter, paleontologist, geologist,  numismatist, and a pioneer in the study of fossils and in scientific illustration. He is known for his paintings and also in the history of paleontology for the book La vana speculazione disingannata dal senso ("Vain Speculation Undeceived by Sense", 1670) which was introduced to English audiences by William Wotton of the Royal Society in 1696. He was among the first to promote a scientific understanding of fossils in contrast to fantastic Biblical and divine interpretations.
