Sardar Muhammad Ibrahim Khan (10 April 1915 â€“ 31 July 2003), also known as Bani-e-Kashmir ("Father of Azad Kashmir") and Ghazi-e-Millat ("Hero of the Nation"), was the founder and first President of Azad Kashmir. He played a pivotal role in Operation Gulmarg .In British India of 1946, he won the Jammu and Kashmir State Assembly election as a member of the Muslim Conference party and became a member of the Praja Sabha under Maharajah Hari Singh. Jammu and Kashmir signed a stand still agreement with Pakistan as a result of the India Independence Act. In 1947, he instigated and organised the Poonch rebellion, with the help of Pakistan Army and the Muslim League, the invasion of Jammu and Kashmir. He belonged to Sudhan tribe. This Pakistani sponsored tribal invasion, despite the stand still agreement was a rude shock to the King. He signed the Instrument of Accession with India  and requested the help of Indian troops to liberate the region. The Prime Minister of India, Nehru also took the dispute to the United Nations as he could not stop the plunder and partial occupation by the invading militia.
After fighting the Indian Army for 15 months, the Azad Kashmir militia accepted a United Nations-mediated ceasefire. Khan and his army were able to capture substantial portions of the three western districts of Kashmir, which were renamed Azad Kashmir.
Khan was appointed the first President of tiny Azad Kashmir in 1948 by Pakistan. He represented Kashmir in different capacities at the United Nations from 1948 to 1971.Sardar Muhammad Ibrahim Khan also wrote a book named The Kashmir Saga on government and politics of Azad Kashmir and history and philosophy of freedom struggle.
