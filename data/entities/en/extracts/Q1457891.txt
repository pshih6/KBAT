Christmas Carol: The Movie is a 2001 British live action/animated film based on Charles Dickens's 1843 classic novella A Christmas Carol. Directed by Jimmy T. Murakami, the film features the voices of numerous actors including Simon Callow, Kate Winslet (who also sang the film's theme "What If"), Kate's sister Beth Winslet, and Nicolas Cage. This version differs from others, in that Scrooge is given another chance with the love of his life, Belle, who ended their engagement in their youth after he was corrupted by greed; they later meet again after the three spirits have reformed Scrooge and he is now kind and generous, causing Belle to love him again.  Both Belle and Old Joe notably have bigger roles in the film.  Unlike the book as well as other film adaptations, Belle does not marry and have children with another man. She is a nurse.  Old Joe is a henchman of Scrooge who arrests or robs people who owe Scrooge debt but Scrooge fires him after mending his ways.  Also in the film Marley's ghost haunts Scrooge before he goes home and Scrooge is notably younger as he has auburn hair and is middle-aged rather than being elderly. He also showns a kindness towards a mouse that appears throughout the film.
