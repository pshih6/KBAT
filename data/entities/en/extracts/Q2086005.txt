Harenchi Gakuen (ハレンチ学園, lit. "Shameless School") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Go Nagai. The manga was one of the first to be serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine in 1968 and became the first big success for Go Nagai. Harenchi Gakuen is widely considered as the first modern erotic manga and credited for being the first ecchi manga series.
The series has been adapted into five live action movies, a live action television series, and an OVA. The live action TV series contains an animated opening sequence which is a recurring element of Go Nagai's works where live action and anime are combined. Other examples include Pro-Wres no Hoshi Aztecaser featuring completely animated action sequences during scenes in which the hero uses his powers and Cutie Honey when the titular heroine appears before the cast, the next scene continues with a full animated opening sequence.
