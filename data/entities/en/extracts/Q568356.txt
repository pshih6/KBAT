Robert Shelton, born Robert Shapiro (June 28, 1926, Chicago, Illinois, United States â€“  December 11, 1995, Brighton, England) was a music and film critic.
Shelton helped to launch the career of a then-unknown 20-year-old Bob Dylan. In 1961, Dylan was performing at Gerdes Folk City in the West Village, one of the best-known folk venues in New York, opening for the bluegrass act the Greenbriar Boys. Shelton's positive review in The New York Times brought crucial publicity to Dylan and led to a Columbia recording contract. Shelton had previously noted Dylan in a review for the New York Times of WRVR's live twelve-hour Hootenanny, July 29, 1961. "Among the newer promising talents deserving mention are a 20-year-old latter-day Guthrie disciple named Bob Dylan, with a curiously arresting mumbling, country-steeped manner." This was Dylan's first live radio performance.
