An intellectual is a person who engages in critical thinking and reading, research, writing, and human self-reflection about society. Many everyday roles require the application of intelligence to skills that may have a psychomotor component—for example, in the fields of medicine or the arts—but these do not necessarily involve the practitioner in the "world of ideas." The intellectual scrutinizes cultural ideas and writings, often using abstract, philosophical, and esoteric aspects of human inquiry to evaluate the thinking of others. The intellectual and the scholarly classes are often related:  the intellectual may be a teacher involved in the production of scholarship and usually has an academic background, or may work in a profession or practice an art or a science. 
The term "intellectual" identifies three traits:

erudition, and development of abstract ideas and theories;
producing cultural capital, as in philosophy, literary criticism, sociology, law,  medicine, science, and so on; and
artistic or creative output, such as writing, composing music, painting and so on.Public intellectuals may propose practical solutions for public affairs issues and gain authority as a public figure. Intellectuals often participate in politics and public affairs, either to defend a proposal or to denounce an injustice, usually by rejecting, producing or extending an ideology, or by defending a system of values.
