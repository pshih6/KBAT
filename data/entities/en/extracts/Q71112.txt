Annette Kolb (born February 3, 1870 in Munich; died December 3, 1967 in Munich) was the working name of German author and pacifist Anna Mathilde Kolb. She became active in pacifist causes during World War I and this caused her political difficulties from then on. She left Germany in the 1920s and her works were banned during the Third Reich. She wrote novels on high society and in later life wrote nonfiction about musicians. In 1955 she won the Goethe Prize.
