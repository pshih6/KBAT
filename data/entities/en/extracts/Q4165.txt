Bad Homburg vor der Höhe is the district town of the Hochtaunuskreis, Hesse, Germany, on the southern slope of the Taunus mountains. Bad Homburg is part of the Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area. The town's formal name is Bad Homburg vor der Höhe (translated as "Bad Homburg before the Height") to distinguish it from other places named Homburg. The name is abbreviated as Bad Homburg v. d. Höhe. It is known best for its medically used mineral waters and spa (hence the prefix Bad, meaning "bath"), and for its casino.
Presently, Bad Homburg is again one of the wealthiest towns in Germany (with the Hochtaunuskreis and the Landkreis Starnberg regularly competing for the title of the wealthiest district in Germany). As of 2004, the town's marketing slogan is Champagnerluft und Tradition (Champagne air and tradition).
