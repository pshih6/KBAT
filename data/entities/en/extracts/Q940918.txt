Hubert van Es (6 July 1941 â€“ 15 May 2009) was a Dutch photographer and photojournalist who took the well-known photo on 29 April 1975, which shows South Vietnamese civilians scrambling to board a CIA Air America helicopter during the U.S. evacuation of Saigon. The picture was taken a day before the Fall of Saigon.
Van Es was variously known in his working life as "Hu", the anglicized "Hugh" and the nickname "Vanes," to rhyme with "planes".
