"Académie Royale" redirects here; not to be confused with the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts or the Académie royale des sciences, des lettres et des beaux-arts, both in Brussels.

The Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture (French: Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, French pronunciation: ​[akademi ʁwajal də pɛ̃tyʁ e də skyltyʁ]; Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was founded in 1648 and located in Paris, France. It was the premier art institution of France during the latter part of the Ancien Régime, until it was abolished in 1793, during the French Revolution. It included most of the important painters and sculptors, maintained almost total control of teaching and exhibitions, and afforded its members preference in royal commissions.
