Gustav Adolf Neuber (24 June 1850 – 13 April 1932) was a German surgeon born in Tondern (today- Tønder.
He studied medicine in several universities, receiving his doctorate in 1875 at the University of Giessen. Later he worked as an assistant to Friedrich von Esmarch (1823-1908) at the University Surgical Clinic in Kiel.
In 1884 he first proposed the use of separate operating rooms for septic and non-septic surgery, emphasizing the need for complete cleanliness in all aspects of surgery. In 1886, he opened his own private hospital on Königsweg in Kiel, where he implemented modern principles of asepsis. Neuber's clinic in Kiel is considered to be the first aseptic hospital in the world.In 1879 he developed a "decalcified bone tube" for wound drainage. In the field of plastic surgery, he introduced a procedure for "fat auto-grafting".
