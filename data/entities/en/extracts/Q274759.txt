Élodie Navarre (born 21 January 1979) is a French actress. Navarre was discovered at 16 when she was spotted on the Paris metro by a casting director and, a year later, appeared in the television film Clara et le Juge. She studied at the Conservatoire d’art dramatique in the 10th arrondissement of Paris and, aged 20, began her professional career as an actor, appearing at the Théâtre de la Criée in Marseille. When she was 22, Navarre suffered multiple fractures after being hit by a car while on holiday in Greece, taking a year to recover. She has since appeared in theatre, film and television.
