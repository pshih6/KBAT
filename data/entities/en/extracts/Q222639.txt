Swashbuckler films are a subgenre of the adventure film genre, often characterised by swordfighting and adventurous heroic characters, known as swashbucklers. Real historical events often feature prominently in the plot, morality is often clear-cut, heroic characters are clearly heroic and even villains tend to have a code of honour (although this is not always the case).  There is often a damsel in distress and a romantic element.
