She was born in Berlin, Germany, in 1904 as Minnie Kronfeld. Born into a Jewish family, she converted to Catholicism in 1928 and took on the name Maria Magdalena. Her Jewish background placed her in great danger in Nazi Germany and in December 1938, she went to live at a Catholic convent at Fenham, England. She was eventually reunited with her husband and children there and the Archbishop of Wellington, Thomas O'Shea, arranged for them to come to New Zealand, where they arrived in August 1939.In the 1980 New Year Honours, Dronke was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the performing arts.
