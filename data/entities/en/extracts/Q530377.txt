Megan Martha White (born December 10, 1974) is an American drummer and occasional singer known for her work in the Detroit rock duo The White Stripes.  Her music career began when, on a whim, she played on Jack White's drums in 1997. Jack was deeply inspired by her minimalist and un-schooled drumming style. The two decided to form a band and began performing two months later. The duo named themselves The White Stripes because of their last name and Meg's fondness for peppermint candy. The band quickly became a Detroit underground favorite before reaching national, then international fame. White has been nominated for various awards as a part of the White Stripes, and has received four Grammy Awards.
Her drumming style has been called "primal" for its simplicity, and has drawn both praise and criticism. Her musical influences are wide and varied, with Bob Dylan being her favorite artist.
White calls herself "very shy", and has kept a low public profile. Meg and Jack White publicly portrayed themselves as siblings. However, public records emerged in 2001 that showed Meg and Jack were not related; in fact they had married in 1996 prior to the band's formation. They divorced in 2000, before The White Stripes ascended to international fame. In 2009, she married guitarist Jackson Smith, son of musicians Patti Smith and Fred "Sonic" Smith. They divorced in 2013.
While on tour in support for The White Stripes' sixth studio album, Icky Thump, White suffered a bout of acute anxiety, and the remaining dates of the tour were cancelled. After a few public appearances, and a hiatus from recording, The White Stripes announced in February 2011 that they would be disbanding. White has not been active in the music industry since.
