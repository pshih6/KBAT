Martin Ehrenhauser (born September the 18, 1978) is an Austrian former Member of the European Parliament (MEP). He took his seat in the parliament in July 2009, when Hans-Peter Martin's List, an independent Austrian list led by author and MEP Hans-Peter Martin gained 17.7% of the Austrian vote in the 2009 elections for the European Parliament. He was defeated in 2014.
He, like his former mentor Hans-Peter Martin, has gained wide media attention for exposing 'scandals' in the European Union.
