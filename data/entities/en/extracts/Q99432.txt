Martin Schiele (17 January 1870 – 16 February 1939) was a German nationalist politician. Schiele was part of the leadership of the German National People's Party (DNVP) from its 1918 founding until Alfred Hugenberg became leader in 1928. He was also the chief representative of the agrarian wing of the DNVP.
As a member of Hans Luther's coalition government Schiele secured the restoration of agricultural and industrial protectionism with the tariff of 1925. As Minister of Food in 1927–28, Schiele favoured state credit as a means for subsidising agriculture.He was persuaded by President Hindenburg to return as Minister of Food in Heinrich Brüning's cabinet. The Agricultural League under Schiele's leadership was criticised by Richard Walther Darré's Nazi Agrarian Apparatus. Schiele ceased to be leader of the Agricultural League shortly after the 1930 election. Unhappy with Hugenberg's leadership, Schiele left the DNVP and moved closer to the Conservative People's Party.
