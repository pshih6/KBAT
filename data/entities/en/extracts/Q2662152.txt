Jerry Michael Reinsdorf (born February 25, 1936) is a CPA, lawyer and an owner of the NBA's Chicago Bulls and the MLB's Chicago White Sox.  He started his professional life as a tax attorney with the Internal Revenue Service. He has been the head of the White Sox and Bulls for over 35 years.
He made his initial fortune in real estate, taking advantage of the Frank Lyon Co. v. United States decision by the United States Supreme Court which allowed economic owners of realty to sell property and lease it back, while transferring the tax deduction for depreciation to the title owner.
As the owner and chairman of the Chicago Bulls since 1985, he has turned the franchise into a lucrative business that won six NBA Championships in the 1990s (1991–1993 and 1996–1998). He is controversial for his involvement (along with Jerry Krause) in breaking up the championship team by not hiring back  Phil Jackson.  He hired Michael Jordan as a baseball player during his sabbatical from basketball.  He also moved the Bulls from Chicago Stadium to the United Center.
Since purchasing the White Sox in 1981, the franchise made the playoffs in 1983 for the first time since 1959, and won the World Series in 2005 for the first time since 1917. Reinsdorf moved the White Sox from Comiskey Park to New Comiskey Park in 1991, which was renamed U.S. Cellular Field in 2003, and once again to Guaranteed Rate Field in 2016. In both sporting endeavors, he has developed a reputation as an anti-labor union hardliner.  Since the early 1990s, he has been considered one of the most, if not the most, influential basketball owners.  He has been influential in instituting the salary cap and revenue sharing.
On April 4, 2016, Reinsdorf was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor.
