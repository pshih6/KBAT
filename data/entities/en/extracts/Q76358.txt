Carl von Ossietzky (3 October 1889 â€“ 4 May 1938) was a German journalist and pacifist and the recipient of the 1935 Nobel Peace Prize for his work in exposing the clandestine German re-armament.Ossietzky was convicted of espionage in 1931 after publishing details of Germany's violation of the Treaty of Versailles by rebuilding an air force (the predecessor of the Luftwaffe) and training pilots in the Soviet Union. Imprisoned, he contracted tuberculosis and died in hospital.
In 1990, his daughter Rosalinde von Ossietzky-Palm called for a resumption of proceedings, but the verdict was upheld by the Federal Court of Justice in 1992.
