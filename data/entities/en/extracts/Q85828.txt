Bruno Diekmann (April 19, 1897 – January 11, 1982) was a German politician (SPD) from Kiel and Minister-President of Schleswig-Holstein (1949–1950).
From May 5, 1991 – May 11, 1992, Diekmann was the oldest former Minister-President of Germany, preceded by Max Seydewitz. He is still the oldest Minister-President of the states of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), succeeded by Werner Bruschke of the GDR. If only Ministers-President of the FRG are counted, he was the oldest since March 27, 1990, preceded by Hans Ehard.
