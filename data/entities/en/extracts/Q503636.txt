Born in Three Rivers, Prince Edward Island, Andrew Archibald Macdonald was descended from the Clanranald branch of the Macdonalds of the Isles, the son of Hugh and Catherine Macdonald of Panmure and grandson of Andrew Macdonald who had purchased a large tract of land in the province and, with his family and retainers, emigrated in 1806 from Inverness-shire, Scotland to settle at Three Rivers, where he and his sons carried on an extensive mercantile business for many years.
He was educated at a county grammar school and by private tutor and also became a merchant and shipowner. In 1863, he married Elizabeth, the third daughter of Hon. Thomas Owen (formerly Provincial Postmaster General) and they had four sons.
