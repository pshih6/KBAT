Chemikal Underground is an independent record label set up in 1994 at Glasgow, Scotland by rock band The Delgados. It was set up to release their first single, "Monica Webster" / "Brand New Car" and went on to break many new Scottish bands in the nineties.
When the second Chemikal Underground release by Bis, The Secret Vampire Soundtrack EP was successful, earning them a slot on Top of the Pops, the label was able to expand. To date, The Secret Vampire Soundtrack is the only Top 40 hit released on Chemikal Underground. Further success followed with the debut albums by Mogwai and Arab Strap.  Other bands on the Chemikal Underground roster included Magoo, Aereogramme, Cha Cha Cohen, Sluts of Trust, Suckle, the Radar Brothers and more recently Mother and the Addicts and De Rosa, as well as Arab Strap member Malcolm Middleton's solo work.  In 2000, they launched Fukd ID to release limited edition (1000 each of CD and 12") singles by bands not necessarily on their roster, such as Interpol (Fukd ID #3).
