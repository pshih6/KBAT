Francis Bosley Crowther Jr. (July 13, 1905 â€“ March 7, 1981) was an American journalist, author, and film critic for The New York Times for 27 years. His work helped shape the careers of many actors, directors and screenwriters, though his reviews, at times, were perceived as unnecessarily mean. Crowther was an advocate of foreign-language films in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly those of Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini.
