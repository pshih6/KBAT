Hermann Joseph von Krippahl ComM, known as Herman José (born 19 March 1954 in Lisbon, Portugal), is a well-known Portugal-based German comedian, though virtually unknown abroad. His career has focused on television.
His mother is Portuguese and his father was German. He is in fact a German citizen: he never acquired dual citizenship, first so he could avoid conscription and the Portuguese Colonial War (1961–74) and secondly because he said “he was not interested”. He went to Lisbon's German school Deutsche Schule Lissabon for all his schooling and is fluent in Portuguese, German, English and French. He lives in Azeitão, Setúbal, and keeps houses in Lisbon and Vilamoura, Algarve.
