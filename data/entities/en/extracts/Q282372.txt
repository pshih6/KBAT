City Heat is a 1984 American buddy crime-comedy film starring Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds, written by Blake Edwards, and directed by Richard Benjamin. The film was released in North America in December 1984.
The pairing of Eastwood and Reynolds was expected to be a major box office hit, but the film earned only a disappointing  $38.3 million, against a $25 million budget.
