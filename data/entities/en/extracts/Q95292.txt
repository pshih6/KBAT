Susanne Uhlen (b. January 17, 1955 in Potsdam, Germany) is a German actress. She is the daughter of actor Wolfgang Kieling and actress Gisela Uhlen, niece to German actor Max Schreck of Nosferatu fame. 
Uhlen began her acting career by doing acting spots in commercials as a child, and appeared in her first film at age 9. As a child, she changed schools each year, as her mother constantly had to relocate to keep up with acting commitments. At 16 she married a fellow student, but her mother became involved and ended the marriage. She then married cameraman Charly Steinberger, with whom she had one son. By this time her acting career was flourishing, but her marriage to Steinberger ended shortly after the birth of their child. In 1981 she met actor Herbert Herrmann, with whom she would have a thirteen-year relationship, producing one child. She has starred in numerous successful German television series, which she continues to do today, along with many film and theater appearances. In 1995 she met and became involved with her current partner, Henry Dawidowicz, a corporate manager for a cosmetics company.
