The Wicker Man is a 2006 horror film written and directed by Neil LaBute and starring Nicolas Cage. The film primarily is a remake of the 1973 British film The Wicker Man, but also draws from its source material, David Pinner's 1967 novel Ritual. The film concerns police officer Edward Malus, whose ex-fianc√©e Willow Woodward informs him that her daughter Rowan has disappeared and asks for his assistance in her search. When he arrives at the island where Rowan was last seen, he suspects something sinister about the neo-pagans who reside on the island.
The film received hostile reviews from film critics at the time of its release; critics pointed to the film's unintentional comedy, weak acting, and poor screenwriting. The film was also a financial flop, grossing over $38 million against a $40 million production budget since its original release.
