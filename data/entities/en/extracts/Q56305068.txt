Kill Six Billion Demons, also referred to as Kill 6 Billion Demons, K6BD, and KSBD, is a fantasy/new weird webcomic, written and illustrated by Tom Parkinson-Morgan under the name "Abbadon", about a young woman named Allison Ruth who obtains an extremely powerful magic item when her boyfriend is kidnapped, discovers a world of supernatural beings ruled by seven powerful entities, and must learn to survive in this strange new setting while attempting to rescue her boyfriend, defeat the entities, and figure out her own destiny.
The comic began as a "Choose Your Own Adventure" thread on the MS Paint Adventures discussion forum in 2012. Parkinson-Morgan converted it into a stand-alone webcomic in 2013, and Image Comics began publishing print compilations in 2016.
