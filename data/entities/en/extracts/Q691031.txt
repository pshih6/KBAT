The concertmaster (from the German Konzertmeister) is the leader of the first violin section in an orchestra (or clarinet, oboe, flute in a concert band) and the instrument-playing leader of the orchestra. After the conductor, the concertmaster is the second-most significant leader in an orchestra, symphonic band or other musical ensemble.  Another common term in the U.S. is "first chair." In the U.K., the term commonly used is "leader."
