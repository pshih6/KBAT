Juan Pablo Duarte (January 26, 1813 – July 15, 1876) was a Dominican writer, activist, poet, military leader and liberal politician who was the foremost of the "founding fathers" of the Dominican Republic. As one of the most celebrated figures in Dominican history, Duarte is considered a folk hero and revolutionary visionary in the modern Dominican Republic, who along with Francisco del Rosario Sánchez and Ramon Matias Mella, organized and promoted the movement, a secret society known as La Trinitaria, that eventually led to the Dominican revolt and independence from Haitian rule in 1844 and the start of a decennial Dominican War of Independence. 
Duarte helped inspire and finance the Dominican War of Independence, paying a heavy toll which would eventually ruin him financially. His liberal views made him a controversial figure among conservative and powerful Dominicans of the time, and he was exiled on numerous occasions after the founding of the new nation. His liberal views went against the conservative elites who sought for heavy-handed control of the nation, and wanted to maintain the traditional regionalisms of the past. Duarte had strong disagreements with the republic's first president, Pedro Santana, as Santana was a tyrannical figure. Ultimately, Duarte would spend many years away from the nation he helped shape and would die in exile, which made him a political martyr in the eyes of subsequent generations.
