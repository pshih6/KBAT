Zazie in the Metro (original French title: Zazie dans le Métro, sometimes called Zazie) is a 1960 French film directed by Louis Malle, based on the novel by Raymond Queneau. Frequently surreal, and full of visual and verbal jokes, the intricate plot follows a group of protean characters around a crowded Paris during a Métro strike.
