Dawn of the Dead (also known internationally as Zombi or  Zombie) is a 1978 independent horror film directed and edited by George A. Romero. An international co-production of the United States and Italy, it was written by Romero in collaboration with Italian filmmaker Dario Argento, and produced by Richard P. Rubinstein, Claudio Argento and Alfredo Cuomo. It is the second film in Romero's Night of the Living Dead series of zombie films, and though it contains no characters or settings from the preceding film Night of the Living Dead (1968), it shows in a larger scale the effects of a zombie apocalypse on society. In the film, a phenomenon of unidentified origin has caused the reanimation of the dead, who prey on human flesh. David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger, and Gaylen Ross star as survivors of the outbreak who barricade themselves inside a suburban shopping mall amid mass hysteria.
Dawn of the Dead was filmed over approximately four months, from late 1977 to early 1978, in the Pennsylvania cities of Pittsburgh and Monroeville. Its primary filming location was the Monroeville Mall. The film was made on a budget estimated at $1.5 million and grossed approximately $55 million worldwide. The film has a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which calls it "one of the most compelling and entertaining zombie films ever made" in its critical consensus.In addition to four official sequels, the film has spawned numerous parodies and pop culture references. A remake was released in 2004.
In 2008, Dawn of the Dead was chosen by Empire magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, along with Night of the Living Dead.
