The Kingdom of Córdoba (Spanish: Reino de Córdoba; English often: Kingdom of Cordova) was a territorial jurisdiction of the Crown of Castile since 1236 until Javier de Burgos' provincial division of Spain in 1833. This was a "kingdom" ("reino") in the second sense given by the Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española: the Crown of Castile consisted of several such kingdoms. Córdoba was one of the Four Kingdoms of Andalusia. Its extent is detailed in Respuestas Generales del Catastro de Ensenada (1750-54), which was part of the documentation of a census.
Like the other kingdoms within Spain, the Kingdom of Córdoba was abolished by the 1833 territorial division of Spain.
