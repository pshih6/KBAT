One-Eyed Jacks is a 1961 American Technicolor Western film starring and directed by Marlon Brando; it was the only film he directed. It was originally planned to be directed by Stanley Kubrick from a screenplay by Sam Peckinpah, but studio disputes led to their replacement by Brando and Guy Trosper. Brando portrays the lead character Rio, and Karl Malden plays his partner, "Dad" Longworth.  The supporting cast features Pina Pellicer, Katy Jurado, Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens. 
In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.
