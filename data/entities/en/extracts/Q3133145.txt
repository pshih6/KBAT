Sir Henry Solomon Wellcome  (August 21, 1853 â€“ July 25, 1936) was an American-born British pharmaceutical entrepreneur. He founded the pharmaceutical company Burroughs Wellcome & Company with his colleague Silas Burroughs in 1880, which is one of the four large companies to eventually merge to form GlaxoSmithKline. In addition, he left a large amount of capital for charitable work in his will, which was used to form the Wellcome Trust, one of the world's largest medical charities. He was also a keen collector of medical artifacts which are now displayed at the Wellcome Collection.
