Abdullah ibn Ja'far (Arabic: عبد الله بن جعفر‎) (c.624-c.699 or 702/704)  was a companion and relative of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, a nephew of Ali ibn Abi Talib and a half-brother of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr. He was loyal to Ahl al-Bayt in spite of his absence at the Battle of Karbala. He is reported to have said: ”Thanks to God Almighty, I could not support al-Husayn ibn Ali at Karbala, but my two sons (’Awn and Muhammad) did.  According to Richard Francis Burton he is widely recognized as the most sympathetic amongst Arabs.  His grave is situated near Aqeel ibn Abi Talib and Abu Sufyan bin al-Harith (the grandson of Abd al-Muttalib) in Janatual Baqi)
