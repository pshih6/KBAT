Edward Samuel Herman (April 7, 1925 â€“ November 11, 2017) was an American economist, media scholar and social critic. Herman is known for his media criticism, in particular his propaganda model hypothesis developed with Noam Chomsky, a frequent co-writer. He held an appointment as Professor Emeritus of finance at the Wharton School of Business of the University of Pennsylvania and a media analyst with a specialty in corporate and regulatory issues as well as political economy. He also taught at Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.
Ideologically, Herman has been described as a "dedicated radical democrat", an ideology which opposes corporate control in favor of direct democracy while distancing itself from other radical movements.
