John Dee (13 July 1527 â€“ 1608 or 1609) was an Anglo-Welsh mathematician, astrologer and occultist, and an advisor to Queen Elizabeth I. He spent much time on alchemy, divination and Hermetic philosophy. He advocated turning England's imperial expansion into a "British Empire", a term he is credited with coining.
