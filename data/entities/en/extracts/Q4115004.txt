Pamela Geller (born 1957/1958) is an American political activist, blogger and commentator who is known for her anti-Muslim views and activism.
In 2006, she reproduced the controversial Danish cartoons of Muhammad published by the Jyllands-Posten newspaper on her blog. She came to further prominence in 2010 for leading the campaign against the proposed Park51 Islamic community center, which Geller called the "Ground Zero Mega Mosque". Since 2013, she has bought anti-Muslim ads on public transit networks in various cities. The British government barred Geller's entry into the UK in 2013, citing her anti-Muslim activism, and saying her presence would "not be conducive to the public good". She has been targeted in two separate assassination attacks by Islamic fundamentalists. She is the president of the American Freedom Defense Initiative (also known as Stop Islamization of America), an anti-Islam group which she co-founded with Robert Spencer.
Multiple media outlets have classified her as "far-right". Geller promoted false conspiracy theories about President Barack Obama, saying that he was born in Kenya and that he is a Muslim. She has denied genocides where Muslims were victims, such as that of Albanians in Kosovo, Bosnians in Srebrenica and the Rohingya in Myanmar.
