Anna Caritas Nitschmann (24 November 1715, Kunín, Moravia – 21 May 1760, Herrnhut, Lusatia) was a Moravian Brethren missionary (Missionarin), lyrical poet, and the second wife of Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf.  
She served as the Chief Eldress of the Renewed Moravian Church for most of her life, from the age of 14. Her duties as Chief Eldress were to serve as a spiritual mentor and counsellor to the female members of the congregations. 
Most of her life was spent in close connection with the Zinzendorf household, although a couple of years were spent doing itinerant mission work among the women of southeastern Pennsylvania. She then returned to Europe to resume her work among the various Moravian congregations. After the death of Zinzendorf's first wife, she was married to him on 27 June 1757, but both of them died within a couple of years. She is buried in Herrnhut, Germany.
