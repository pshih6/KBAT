Country pop (also known as pop country) is a fusion genre of country music and pop music that was developed by members of the country genre out of a desire to reach a larger, mainstream audience. By producing country songs that employed many styles and sounds found in pop music, the country music industry sought to gain new listeners without alienating its traditional country audience. Country pop music blends genres like rock, pop, and country, continuing similar efforts that began in the late 1950s, known originally as Nashville sound and later on as Countrypolitan. By the mid-1970s, many country artists were transitioning to the pop-country sound, which led to some records' charting high on mainstream top 40 as well as the country Billboard charts.
