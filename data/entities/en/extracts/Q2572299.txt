Nasiruddin Nasrat Shah (Bengali: নাসিরউদ্দিন নুসরাত শাহ)  (died 1533), son of Sultan Alauddin Hussain Shah, was sultan of Bengal from 1519 until his assassination in 1533.  He married Ibrahim Lodi's daughter. He continued his father's expansionist policies after succeeding him, adding more territory to his sultanate early on in his reign, but after 1526 had to contend with the Mughal ascendency in the Battle of Ghaghra, and also suffered a reverse at the hands of the Ahom kingdom.
