Kimberly Kane (born August 28, 1983) was born in Tacoma, WA, and moved to Los Angeles, CA in 2004 to pursue a career in adult entertainment. She signed with Mark Spiegler of spieglergirls.com, known as the elite agency of the adult film industry. Kane quickly became a popular name in adult film for her genuine performances on camera. In 2006, at the age of 21, she directed her first movie for Pulse Pictures entitled Naked & Famous, which received a 5-star review from AVN Magazine, the highest rating they give. Shortly after, Vivid Entertainment approached Kane to direct for Vivid-Alt, a branch dedicated to providing artists a platform to create high-end adult content with an alternative look to standard pornography.
