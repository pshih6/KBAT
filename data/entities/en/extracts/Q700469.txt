The Germans of Romania or Rum√§niendeutsche, are an ethnic group of Romania. During the interwar period in Romania, the total number of ethnic Germans amounted to as much as c. 800,000 (according to some sources and estimates dating to 1939, just prior to the beginning of World War II), a figure which has subsequently fallen to c. 36,000 as of 2011 in contemporary Romania.
