Blind Joe Hill (January 7, 1931 â€“ November 1998) was an American blues singer, guitarist, harmonica player and drummer.
A one-man band, he was adopted and named Joseph Thomas Hill after being born in Dunbar, West Virginia, United States. He played in the styles of Joe Hill Louis and Doctor Ross. He used his craggy vocals supported by guitar, bass, and drums, and was one of the last practitioners of the one-man blues band tradition. Hill recorded two albums under his own name on the Barrelhouse and L+R labels, and was part of the 1985 American Folk Blues Festival touring Europe.
He died in Los Angeles, California, and was cremated on November 17, 1998.
