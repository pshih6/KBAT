Noe Zhordania (Georgian: ნოე ჟორდანია /nɔɛ ʒɔrdɑniɑ/; Russian: Ной Никола́евич Жорда́ния; born January 14 [O.S. 2 January] 1868 (or 21 March [O.S. 9 March] 1869) — January 11, 1953) was a Georgian journalist and Menshevik politician. He played an eminent role in the socialist revolutionary movement in the Russian Empire, and later chaired the government of the Democratic Republic of Georgia from July 24, 1918 until March 18, 1921, when the Bolshevik Russian Red Army invasion of Georgia forced him into exile to France. There Zhordania led the government-in-exile until his death in 1953.
