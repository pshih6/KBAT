Paul Boucherot (1869–1943) was an engineer with the Chemins de Fer du Nord (Northern Railway of France).  He studied at the elite École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris (ESPCI) where he later also taught electrical engineering.  He was a pioneer of AC electric power distribution, designed induction motors, and with Georges Claude, built early plants for obtaining thermal energy from the sea.  He also contributed to electrical analysis, including the relationship between real and apparent power.
