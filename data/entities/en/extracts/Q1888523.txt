Giovanni Battista Agostino Codazzi (alternatively known in Latin America as Agust√≠n Codazzi; 12 July 1793 - 7 February 1859) was an Italo-Venezuelan soldier, scientist, geographer, cartographer, and governor of Barinas (1846-1847). He made his main investigations and cartographic work in Venezuela and Colombia, thereby creating for both countries a complete set of maps and statistics after the tumultuous post-independence years from the Spanish Empire.
