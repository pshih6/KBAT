Mohamed Sifaoui (in Arabic محمد سيفاوي) (born 4 July 1967) is an Algerian-French journalist and writer who claimed that he managed to infiltrate al-Qaeda. He wrote a book about the experience, Mes "frères" assassins. Comment j'ai infiltré une cellule d'Al-Qaïda (meaning My assassin "brothers": How I infiltrated an al-Qaeda cell).
Many journalists criticize his ethics as his TV documentaries relate fictive situations and are polemical staging. Sifaoui has also been reprimanded by the Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel, the institution regulating the French media, for several racist comments.
