Täby (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈtɛ̌ːbʏ] (listen)) was a trimunicipal locality and the seat of Täby Municipality in Stockholm County, Sweden, with 66,292 inhabitants in 2013. It was also partly located in Danderyd Municipality (the Enebyberg area) and a very small part of Sollentuna Municipality. As from 2016 Statistics Sweden has amalgamated this locality with the Stockholm urban area.
However, Täby kyrkby in the northern part of Täby Municipality still forms part of the Vallentuna urban area.
