Bonnie M. Anderson is a veteran news reporter. Anderson got her start covering Latin America and the Miami Hispanic community for El Miami Herald in Miami. After a year reporting for WPLG-TV in Miami, the ABC affiliate, she worked for NBC News as one of the network's two Latin America correspondents. She later served as a correspondent for the network posted in Beirut and Rome, before joining The Miami News as a columnist. Just prior to joining CNN in 1992, Anderson served a four-year stint with WTVJ in Miami.
Her first position at CNN was a national correspondent, where she covered such top breaking news stories as the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the Los Angeles earthquake in 1994, Pope John Paul II's 1995 visit to Denver, Hurricane Andrew in South Florida in 1992 and the Branch Davidian stand-off in Waco, Texas, in 1993. She also produced numerous documentaries on cutting-edge topics such as incest and priest pedophilia. Anderson was one of the first female war correspondents in the industry and has reported from over 100 countries. During her time with NBC and CNN she was shot at – and wounded while reporting.
Anderson served as an anchor and as an international war correspondent before rising to the position of managing editor of CNN en Español, CNN's fledgling 24-hour Spanish language news network. She formed part of the core group that developed, launched and supervised the network for the first three years. During her final years with CNN, Anderson acted as vice president in charge of recruiting and talent development for the CNN News Group. In 2002 Anderson was unceremoniously terminated from CNN for refusing to comply with a hiring policy she considered “unethical, unprincipled, immoral, and potentially illegal.” She filed suit against CNN in August 2003.
