Béla Kun (20 February 1886 – 29 August 1938), born Béla Kohn, was a Hungarian Communist activist and politician who was the de facto dictator of the Hungarian Soviet Republic and perpetrator of the Red Terror in 1919.
Though the de jure leader of the Hungarian Soviet Republic was president Sándor Garbai, the de facto power was in the hands of foreign minister Béla Kun, who maintained direct contact with Lenin via radiotelegraph. It was Lenin who gave the direct orders and advice to Béla Kun via constant radio communication with the Kremlin.Following the collapse of the Communist regime, Kun fled to the Soviet Union, where he worked as a functionary in the Communist International bureaucracy as the head of the Crimean Revolutionary Committee from 1920. He organised and actively participated in the Red Terror in Crimea (1920–1921), following which he participated in the March Action (1921), a failed Communist uprising in Germany.
During the Great Purge of the late 1930s, Kun was arrested, interrogated, tried, and executed in quick succession. He was posthumously rehabilitated by the Soviet regime in 1956, following the death of Joseph Stalin and the critical reassessment of Stalinism.
