Tomislav Ivčić (6 January 1953 – 4 March 1993) was a Croatian pop singer, songwriter and politician. He died in a car accident and is buried in Zagreb at the Mirogoj Cemetery.
A native of Zadar, Tomislav Ivčić became one of the most popular singers and songwriters during his appearances on 1970s pop music festivals. His specialty was pop music inspired by Dalmatian folklore. One of his early hits included the country-rock influenced single "Nemam za kavu" from 1979. Ivčić also wrote and performed "Večeras je naša fešta", a song that would become a semi-official anthem of Dalmatia, often sung and performed whenever a Dalmatian athlete or sports team won a title or important game. He has written over two hundred songs and released twenty three albums during his career.
During the war in Croatia, Ivčić wrote the song "Stop the War in Croatia" which became a hit. It even charted in the Top 10 in Australia in 1991. In 1990, Ivčić also became a member of Croatian Democratic Union. In February 1993 he ran as  his party's candidate for House of Chambers of Croatian Parliament, and won a seat. A few weeks before he was supposed to take office and shortly after a Globus interview in which he was described as "first Croatian senator," his automobile was involved in traffic accident that would claim his and lives of three more people.
His older half-brother Đani Maršan is also an accomplished singer and songwriter, and his other older brother Vedran Ivčić, was, to a lesser degree, as well.
