Barsuk Records ( bar-SOOK) is an independent record label based in Seattle, Washington, that was founded by the members of the band This Busy Monster, Christopher Possanza and Josh Rosenfeld, in 1998 to release their band's material. Its logo is a drawing of a dog holding a vinyl record in its mouth.
The name of the label comes from the Russian word барсук [barˈsuk], "badger". However, the label is named after Christopher Possanza and Jason Avinger's dog, a black Labrador. The dog can be heard barking in two This Busy Monster tracks: "Song 69" and "Time to Sleep".
