Michel Michelet (July 14, 1894 â€“ December 28, 1995) was a composer of film scores. Born as Mikhail Isaakovich Levin to a Jewish family in Kiev (then in the Russian Empire), he moved to Western Europe before settling in France where he became a celebrated composer. He worked on many films during the 1930s following the introduction of sound film. Following the Nazi invasion of France in 1940, he emigrated to the United States where he continued to work on Hollywood productions including several films noir. Later he provided scores for some European films in the post-war era.
He was nominated twice at the 17th Academy Awards for Best Original Score but did not win.
