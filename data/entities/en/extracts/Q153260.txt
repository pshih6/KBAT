Bad Godesberg (KÃ¶lsch: Bad Jodesbersch) is a municipal district of Bonn, southern North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. From 1949 to 1999, while Bonn was the capital of West Germany and later Germany, most foreign embassies were in Bad Godesberg. Some buildings are still used as branch offices or consulates.
