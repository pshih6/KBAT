Pomona College is a private liberal arts college in Claremont, California. It was founded in 1887 by a group of Congregationalists who wanted to recreate a "college of the New England type" in Southern California, and in the 1920s, it became the founding member of the Claremont Colleges consortium.
Pomona is a four-year undergraduate institution, and enrolled approximately 1,700 students representing all 50 U.S. states and 63 countries as of fall 2018.
