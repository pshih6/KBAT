Anyte of Tegea (Greek: Ἀνύτη Τεγεᾶτις, Anýtē Tegeâtis; fl. early 3rd century BC) was an Arcadian poet. She is one of the nine outstanding ancient women poets listed by Antipater of Thessalonica in the Palatine Anthology. He called her the female Homer because her poetry was so admired. She was among the first Hellenistic poets to write bucolic poetry that praised life in the country. She was called "Anyte the lyric poet" in antiquity, although none of her lyric poetry has survived. Likewise, Pausanias refers to her epic poetry, but none of it has survived.
