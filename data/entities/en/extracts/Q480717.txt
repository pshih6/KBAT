Konrad VI the Dean (Polish: Konrad VI Dziekan ) (ca. 1391 – 3 September 1427) was a Duke of Oleśnica, Koźle, half of Bytom and half of Ścinawa since 1416 (with his brothers as co-rulers).
He was the third son of Konrad III the Old, Duke of Oleśnica, by his wife Judith. Like his two older and two younger brothers, at his baptism he received the name of Konrad, which was characteristic in this branch of the House of Piast.
