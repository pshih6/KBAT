Chinese people are the various individuals or ethnic groups associated with China, usually through ancestry, ethnicity, nationality, citizenship, or other affiliation.The Han Chinese are the largest ethnic group in China, comprising approximately 92% of its mainland population. Han Chinese people also comprise approximately 95% of the population of Taiwan, approximately 92% of the population of Hong Kong, and approximately 89% of the population of Macau. They are also the world's largest ethnic group, comprising approximately 18% of the global human population.Outside of China, the terms "Han Chinese" and "Chinese" are often conflated since those identifying or registered as Han Chinese are the most populous ethnic group in China. In fact, there are 55 officially-recognized ethnic minorities in China who may also identify as "Chinese".
Although Hong Kong and Macau are both under Chinese sovereignty, both regions are highly autonomous. Hong Kong and Macau are respectively governed by international treaties known as the "Sino-British Joint Declaration" and the "Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration". Residents of both regions can possess various nationalities.
People from Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), may also be referred to as "Chinese" in various contexts, though they are usually referred to as "Taiwanese". The territory of Taiwan is disputed and the ROC has limited recognition of its sovereignty.
There is also an extensive Chinese diaspora known as the "Overseas Chinese".
