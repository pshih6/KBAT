Jade Cerisa Lorraine Goody (5 June 1981 â€“ 22 March 2009) was an English reality television personality. She entered the public spotlight in the third series of the then-Channel 4 programme Big Brother in 2002, an appearance which led to her own television programmes and the introduction of her products after her eviction from the show.Immediately criticised by the British press for her perceived lack of decorum and intelligence, Goody was dubbed by multiple outlets as "the most hated woman in Britain". The country's celebrity magazines were less derisive, publishing reports of her affable nature and competent school performance from those who knew her. Public opinion of Goody reached its most negative in January 2007, however, when she was the perpetrator of racial bullying towards Indian actress Shilpa Shetty while appearing as a housemate on Celebrity Big Brother 5. Following her eviction, Goody made a number of apologies, but continued to garner negative public reactions.In August 2008, Goody appeared on the Indian version of Big Brother, Bigg Boss, but left the show early and returned to the UK after learning that she had cervical cancer. By February 2009, the cancer had metastasized, and Goody was terminally ill. She married fellow Celebrity Big Brother contestant Jack Tweed on 22 February 2009, and died one month later, in the early hours of 22 March 2009, at the age of 27.Public opinion of Goody had softened by the time of her death. Sky Living broadcast five tribute shows from 2009 to 2012, documenting her life from early childhood through her rise to fame and her final months. The last episode of Big Brother on Channel 4 featured a 15-minute tribute to Goody, praising her as the ultimate Big Brother contestant. She was one of several people to appear on the front cover of the final edition of News of the World on 10 July 2011.
