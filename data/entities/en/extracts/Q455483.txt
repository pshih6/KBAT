Joan Peters (née Friedman; April 29, 1936 – January 5, 2015), later Caro, was the author of the best-selling, controversial, 1984 book From Time Immemorial, in which she argued that Palestinians are largely not indigenous to modern Israel and therefore do not have a claim to its territory. The book was criticized by some scholars such as Norman Finkelstein, Noam Chomsky, Edward Said and Yehoshua Porath.
