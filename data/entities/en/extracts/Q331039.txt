The Far Country is a 1955 American Technicolor Western romance film directed by Anthony Mann and starring James Stewart, Ruth Roman, Walter Brennan and Corinne Calvet. Written by Borden Chase, the film is about a self-minded adventurer who locks horns with an evil, crooked judge while driving cattle to Dawson. It is one of the few Westerns, along with The Spoilers and North to Alaska, to be set (not filmed) in Alaska. This is the fourth Western film collaboration between Anthony Mann and James Stewart.
