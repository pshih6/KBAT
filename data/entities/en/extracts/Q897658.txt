The Social Democratic Party of Hungary (Hungarian: Magyarországi Szociáldemokrata Párt, MSZDP) is a social democratic political party in Hungary. Historically, the party was dissolved during the occupation of Hungary by Nazi Germany (1944-1945) and the communist period of Hungary from 1948 to 1989, after being forced into a merger with the Communist Party. It worked legally for a short time during the Revolution of 1956.
It was a government party as a part of the Károlyi Government (1918-1919), Berinkey Government, Peidl Government (1919), Interim National Assembly (1944-1945) and Dinnyés Government (1947-1948). It was reorganized after Hungary's transition from communism in 1989.
MSZDP used to be a member of the Socialist International and the Party of European Socialists until 2020, when it was delisted from both due to inactivity.
