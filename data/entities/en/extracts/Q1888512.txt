Shadow Star, known in Japan as Narutaru (Japanese: なるたる), is a Japanese manga series created by Mohiro Kitoh, originally serialized in Kodansha's seinen magazine Afternoon.  The Japanese name is an abbreviation of Mukuro Naru Hoshi, Tama Taru Ko (骸なる星 珠たる子), which roughly translates to Corpse of a Star; A Precious Child. In the United States, it was licensed by Dark Horse and serialized in Super Manga Blast!.
The 13-episode anime adaptation by Planet was broadcast in 2003 on the Japanese television station Kids Station. The anime was licensed by Central Park Media and released as Shadow Star Narutaru, and has played on Comcast's Anime Selects multiple times. In 2007 it ran on the Illusion on Demand television network. Central Park Media released the title under their "U.S. Manga Corps" line, on 4 DVDs, and later re-released the DVDs in a box set. Central Park Media filed for bankruptcy in 2009, and the DVDs have since been out of print.
