Marcus Porcius Cato (; 234â€“149 BC), also known as Cato the Elder (Latin: Cato Major), the Censor (Censorius), the Wise (Sapiens), and the Ancient (Priscus), was a Roman soldier, senator and historian known for his conservatism and opposition to Hellenization. He was the first to write history in Latin. His epithet "Elder" distinguishes him from his equally famous great-grandson Cato the Younger, who opposed Julius Caesar.
He came from an ancient Plebeian family who were noted for their military service. Like his forefathers, Cato was devoted to agriculture when not serving in the army. Having attracted the attention of Lucius Valerius Flaccus, he was brought to Rome and began to follow the cursus honorum: he was successively military tribune (214 BC), quaestor (204 BC), aedile (199 BC), praetor (198 BC), junior consul (195 BC) together with Flaccus, and censor (184 BC). As praetor, he expelled usurers from Sardinia. As censor, he tried to save Rome's ancestral customs and combat "degenerate" Hellenistic influences.
