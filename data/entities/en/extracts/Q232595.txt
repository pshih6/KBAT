The Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (自由民主党, Jiyū-Minshutō), frequently abbreviated to LDP or Jimintō (自民党), is a conservative political party in Japan.
The LDP has almost continuously been in power since its foundation in 1955—a period called the 1955 System—with the exception of a period between 1993 and 1994, and again from 2009 to 2012. In the 2012 election it regained control of government. It holds 285 seats in the lower house and 113 seats in the upper house, and in coalition with the Komeito, the governing coalition has a supermajority in both houses. Prime Minister Shinzō Abe and many present and former LDP ministers are also known members of Nippon Kaigi, an ultranationalist and monarchist organization.The LDP is not to be confused with the now-defunct Liberal Party (自由党, Jiyūtō), which merged with the Democratic Party of Japan (民主党, Minshutō) to become the Democratic Party (民進党, Minshintō), the main opposition party until 2017. The LDP is also not to be confused with the Liberal Party (自由党, Jiyū-tō), a former minor social liberal party founded in 2016.
