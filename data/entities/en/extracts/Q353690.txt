Adel Emam (Arabic: عادل إمام‎; born May 17, 1940) is an Egyptian legendary film, television, and stage actor. He is primarily a comedian, but he has starred in more serious works and, especially in his earlier films, has combined comedy with romance.
Emam earned a bachelor's degree in Agriculture from Cairo University. Since then he has appeared in over 103 movies and 10 plays. He is one of the most famous actors and comedians in Egypt, the Arab world, entire MENA and even has some international audience, he has received critical (mainly politically and popular praise throughout his career). Emam's roles have displayed a wide range of humour including slapstick, farce, and even the occasional double entendre. His character archetype is an individual down on his luck who rises above powerful outside pressures.
In January 2000, the United Nations appointed Emam as a Goodwill Ambassador for UNHCR
