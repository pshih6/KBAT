Éric Justin Léon Zemmour (born 31 August 1958) is a French essayist, political journalist and writer. His anti-liberal and anti-immigration positions, as well as the numerous controversies he has been involved in, are notorious in his homeland. With the publication of The French Suicide (French: Le Suicide français) in 2014, a book for which he was awarded the Prix Combourg-Chateaubriand the following year, he gained popularity outside of France. He also received the Prix Richelieu in 2011 for the whole of his career as a journalist.
Born in Montreuil, he studied at Sciences Po. He was hired by Le Quotidien de Paris in 1986, before working as a reporter for Le Figaro from 1996 until 2009 and has since had a column in Le Figaro Magazine. Zemmour has appeared as a television personality on shows such as On n'est pas couché on France 2
(2006–2011), Ça se dispute on I-Télé (2003–2014) and Face à l'Info on CNews (since 2019). He has also appeared on Zemmour et Naulleau since 2011, a weekly evening talk show on Paris Première, together with Éric Naulleau. He worked for RTL from 2010 until 2019, first hosting the radio show Z comme Zemmour and later joining Yves Calvi's morning news show as an analyst.
