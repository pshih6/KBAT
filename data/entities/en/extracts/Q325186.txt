The National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (Dutch: Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging in Nederland, Dutch pronunciation: [nɑtsjoːˈnaːl soːʃaːˈlɪstisə bəˈʋeːɣɪŋ ɪn ˈneːdərlɑnt], NSB) was a Dutch fascist and later Nazi political party that called itself a “movement”. As a parliamentary party participating in legislative elections, the NSB had some success during the 1930s. It remained the only legal party in the Netherlands during most of the Second World War.
