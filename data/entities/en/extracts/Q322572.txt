Autumn Sonata (Swedish: HÃ¶stsonaten, German: Herbstsonate) is a 1978 Swedish-German psychological drama film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman, and starring Ingrid Bergman (in her final film role), Liv Ullmann and Lena Nyman. Its plot follows a celebrated classical pianist and her neglected daughter who meet for the first time in years, and chronicles their painful discussions of how they have hurt one another.
Autumn Sonata was the last of Bergman's films to be made for theatrical exhibition; all of his films made after it, even those screened in theatres, were television productions.
