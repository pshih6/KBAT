Werner Maser (12 July 1922 – 5 April 2007) was a German historian, journalist and professor at the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg. Werner was the first historian to claim that the Hitler Diaries were forgeries.He was born in East Prussia to a farmer and horse breeder. During the Second World War he served in the German Army as an infantry officer. After Germany's defeat, Maser was interned by the Soviets in Sachsenhausen concentration camp. After his release, he studied theology, philosophy and political science at Berlin, Munich and Erlangen. His doctoral thesis was titled The Organisation of the Führer Legend. Maser was appointed professor of history at the University of Munich and he was also a guest professor at universities in America, Japan and Finland. He discovered Hitler's medical records, which had been thought lost.During the late 1970s Werner claimed that Hitler had fathered a son (Jean-Marie Loret) with a French peasant dancer in 1918.He was a critic of the works of Alan Bullock and Sebastian Haffner. In his 1994 work Der Wortbruch: Hitler, Stalin und der Zweite Weltkrieg ("The Broken Agreement: Hitler, Stalin and the Second World War"), Maser argued that the Soviets were preparing to invade Germany and that Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union pre-empted the planned Soviet invasion of Germany by two weeks. He also wrote biographies of German Presidents Friedrich Ebert, Paul von Hindenburg and Helmut Kohl.
