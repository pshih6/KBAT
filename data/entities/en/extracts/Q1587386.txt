Bossel was a professor of environmental systems analysis and director of the Scientific Center for Environmental Systems Research and Environmental Systems Analysis Group at the University of Kassel, Germany, until his retirement in 1997.Bossel collaboratively developed a number of computer simulation models and decision support systems in the following areas: energy supply policy, global dynamics, orientation of behavior, agricultural policy, forest dynamics and management, sustainable development, and indicator systems.  Bossel also wrote a number of textbooks on the modeling and simulation of dynamic systems, social change, future paths, and sustainable development.
