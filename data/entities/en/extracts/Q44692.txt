John Charles Layfield (born November 29, 1966), better known by the ring name John "Bradshaw" Layfield (abbreviated JBL), is an American businessman, retired professional wrestler and television personality currently signed with the WWE on a part-time basis. Layfield is currently a financial commentator featured regularly on Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network.  He is also employed by Northeast Securities as its Senior Vice President.Layfield rose to prominence in WWE (then the World Wrestling Federation, WWF) during its Attitude Era under the ring name Bradshaw, during which time he became a three-time WWF Tag Team Champion with Ron "Farooq" Simmons as part of the Acolyte Protection Agency (APA). In 2004, the APA separated and Layfield was rebranded as JBL – a wealthy, big mouthed businessman – based on Layfield's real-life accomplishments as a stock market investor. Later that year, he captured his only world heavyweight championship, the WWE Championship, and held it for 280 days, making him the longest reigning champion of the SmackDown brand at that point. A month before his in-ring retirement at 2009's WrestleMania XXV, he became Intercontinental Champion, which made him the twentieth Triple Crown Champion and the tenth Grand Slam Champion in WWE history. During his career Layfield was accused of perpetrating various pranks or hazing upon other WWE employees. After his retirement, Layfield became an on-air commentator for WWE programming. Layfield will be inducted into the 2020 WWE Hall of Fame.
