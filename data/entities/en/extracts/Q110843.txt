The Moderate Party (Swedish: Moderata samlingspartiet, M, literally "Moderate Coalition Party" or "Moderate Unity Party"; commonly referred to as Moderaterna: "Moderates") is a liberal-conservative political party in Sweden. 
The party generally supports tax cuts, the  free market, civil liberties and economic liberalism. Internationally, it is a full member of the International Democrat Union and European People's Party.The party was founded in 1904 as the General Electoral League (Allmänna valmansförbundet) by a group of conservatives in the Riksdag, the Swedish parliament. The party was later known as The Right (Högern, 1938–1952) and Right Wing Party (Högerpartiet, 1952–1969). During this time, the party was usually called the Conservative Party outside of Sweden. 
After holding minor posts in centre-right governments, the Moderates eventually became the leading opposition party to the Swedish Social Democratic Party and since then those two parties have dominated Swedish politics. After the 1991 general election, party leader Carl Bildt formed a minority government, the first administration since 1930 to be headed by a member of the party, which lasted three years. The party was returned in government, under party leader and Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, after the 2006 and 2010 general elections. In 2010 the party, which was the leading member of the centre-right Alliance coalition (along with the Liberal People's Party, the Christian Democrats and the Centre Party), obtained its best result ever (30.1%).
The current chairman of the party, Ulf Kristersson, was elected at a special party congress on 1 October 2017, following Anna Kinberg Batra's sudden resignation. Kinberg Batra had replaced Reinfeldt, Prime Minister from 2006 to 2014. Under Reinfeldt's leadership, the party moved more towards the centre in Swedish politics.
