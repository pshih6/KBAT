Peter Monteverdi (7 June 1934 â€“ 4 July 1998) was a Swiss carmaker and creator of the car brand Monteverdi.
At the beginning of his career, Monteverdi was a car salesman. His father ran a garage and truck business, which Peter used as his initial inspiration. He built his Monteverdi Special in 1952 using the remains of a wrecked 1949 Fiat. It is now on display at the Swiss Transport Museum in Lucerne. In 1957 he acquired the Swiss franchise for Ferrari, subsequently becoming Swiss importer for other international prestige brands including Rolls-Royce and Bentley. In 1952, he started producing cars under his own name.
