Heinz Lammerding (27 August 1905 â€“ 13 January 1971) was an SS functionary and war criminal during the Nazi era. During World War II, he commanded the SS Division Das Reich that perpetrated the Tulle and the Oradour-sur-Glane massacres in occupied France. After the war, Lammerding was convicted in absentia for having ordered the murder of approximately 750 French civilians, but remained protected by Germany after serving a prison sentence there.
