The New World is a 2005 British-American epic romantic historical drama film written and directed by Terrence Malick, depicting the founding of the Jamestown, Virginia, settlement and inspired by the historical figures Captain John Smith, Pocahontas of the Powhatan tribe, and Englishman John Rolfe. It is the fourth feature film written and directed by Malick.
The cast includes Colin Farrell, Q'orianka Kilcher, Christopher Plummer, Christian Bale, August Schellenberg, Wes Studi, David Thewlis and Yorick van Wageningen. The production team includes director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki, producer Sarah Green, production designer Jack Fisk, costume designer Jacqueline West and film editors Richard Chew, Hank Corwin, Saar Klein and Mark Yoshikawa.
The New World received many award nominations for Lubezki's cinematography, Kilcher's acting and Horner's score. The work was initially met with an only mildly positive critical response, although several critics later ranked it as one of the best films of the decade.
