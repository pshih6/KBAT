Juan Ramón Jiménez Mantecón (Spanish pronunciation: [xwan raˈmoŋ xiˈmeneθ manteˈkon]; 23 December 1881 – 29 May 1958) was a Spanish poet, a prolific writer who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1956 "for his lyrical poetry, which in the Spanish language constitutes an example of high spirit and artistical purity". One of Jimenez's most important contributions to modern poetry was his advocacy of the French concept of "pure poetry."
