Australians are people associated with the country of Australia, usually holding Australian citizenship. Australia is a multicultural society and has the world's ninth-largest immigrant population, with immigrants accounting for 29 percent of the population as of 2017.Between 1788 and the Second World War, the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from the British Isles (principally England, Ireland and Scotland). Many early British settlements were penal colonies to house transported convicts. Immigration of "free settlers" increased exponentially from the 1850s, following a series of gold rushes. In the decades immediately following the Second World War, Australia received a large wave of immigration from across Europe, with many more immigrants arriving from Southern and Eastern Europe than in previous decades. Since the end of the White Australia policy in 1973, Australia has pursued an official policy of multiculturalism, and there has been a large and continuing wave of immigration from across the world, with the primary sources of immigrants today being Asian countries. A smaller proportion are descended from Australia's indigenous peoples, comprising Aboriginal Australians, Aboriginal Tasmanians and Torres Strait Islanders.The development of a separate Australian identity and national character began in the 19th century, linked with the anti-transportation and nativist movements and the Eureka Rebellion during the colonial period and culminated in the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901. The primary language is Australian English, and Australian culture and literature developed from "Anglo-Celtic" traditions. However, modern Australian identity draws on a variety of cultural heritages beyond the previous monoculture.
