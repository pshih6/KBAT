Roadside Romeo is a 2008 3D Indian-American computer animated romantic comedy film written and directed by Jugal Hansraj in his directorial debut., produced by Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra of Yash Raj Films and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures in United States, United Kingdom and India. The film follows a dog living in Mumbai, as voiced by Saif Ali Khan, and his girlfriend, Laila, voiced by Kareena Kapoor. This was the first voice-over in an animated production for both actors.
It was released on 24 October 2008 in the United States and India. An Arabic dub was released in Kuwait on a day earlier. This was the second Bollywood film to receive a North American release by a Hollywood studio, following Sony Pictures' Saawariya (2007). The film received generally negative reviews from critics, with most of the criticism focused on the film's script, predictable plot, Hansraj's direction and overuse of cliches.
