Katharina Rutschky (25 January 1941, Berlin – 14 January 2010,  Berlin) was a German educationalist and author. She coined the term Schwarze Pädagogik (literally black pedagogy) in her eponymous book from 1977, describing physical and psychical violence as part of education (a notion elaborated upon some years later by Alice Miller). Until her death, Rutschky lived with her husband Michael Rutschky in Berlin.
