Kajetan Abgarowicz (pseudonyms: Kajetan Abgar-Soltan, and Soltan Abgar; Armenian: Կայտան Աբգարովիչ) (August 7, 1856 in Czerniowie, Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria – July 27, 1909 in Truskavets, Ukraine) was a Polish journalist, novelist and short story writer of Armenian descent.
Born into a family of landowners, his parents were Franciszka and Salomei Przysieckich. Abgarowicz attended schools in Stanislawow and Lviv, Ukraine. He made his debut in the press as a novelist in 1889. He was co-founder in 1901 of the Lviv newspaper Przedświt, and also ran the literary section. He collaborated with other magazines of Lviv, Krakow and Warsaw, such as Słowo Polskie, Gazeta Lwowska (1894), Czas, Nowa Reforma and Tygodnik Ilustrowany.A popular humorist, Abgarowicz wrote in the mainstream genres of Polish popular fiction, romance, and adventure. Many of his short stories and novels were published, most of which centred on the nobility, especially from the Podolia region, featuring young squires leading an active social life. Abgarowicz was also interested in the life of Rusyns and contributed to the popularity of Hutsuls culture in Poland. While his novels, such as Klub nietoperzy (two volumes, the first of which was published in 1892), Polubowna ugoda (1894), and Z wiejskiego dworu (1895), were characterized as being weak, his collections of short stories and sketches, such as Z carskiej imperii (1892), Rusini (1893) and Widziane i odczute (1904), did not receive the same criticism.
