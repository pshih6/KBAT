In 1854, the family emigrated to the United States, spending the first year in New York. They moved to Wisconsin in 1855, arriving through New Orleans.Josephine died in April 1860 and Miller married Lisette Gross and had five children who survived infancy: Ernst, Emil, Frederick II, Clara, and Elise.

Following his death, the company was run by his surviving three sons and son-in-law Carl.Miller's younger daughter Elise was the mother of Harry G. John (1919–1992), president of the company from 1946–1947 and founder of the De Rance Corporation, once the world's largest Catholic charity.Older daughter Clara's son Frederick C.
