Hans Carl Artmann (12 June 1921 in Vienna â€“ 4 December 2000 in Vienna), also known as Ib Hansen, was (amongst other things) an Austrian-born poet and writer, most popular for his early poems written in Viennese (med ana schwoazzn dintn, 1958), which however, never after were to be the focus of his oeuvre.
