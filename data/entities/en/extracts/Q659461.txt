The Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland (German: Christlichdemokratische Volkspartei der Schweiz, CVP; French: Parti Démocrate-Chrétien, PDC; Italian: Partito Popolare Democratico, PPD; Romansh: Partida cristiandemocratica Svizra , PCD) is a Christian-democratic political party in Switzerland.  It is the fifth-largest party in the National Council, with 28 seats, and the largest in the Council of States, with 13 seats.  It has one seat, that of Viola Amherd, on the Swiss Federal Council.
The party was founded as the Catholic Conservative Party in 1912.  The party peaked in the 1950s, having three members of the Federal Council (1954–58) before agreeing to the Magic formula.  It adopted its current name in 1970.  From 1979 to 2003, the party's vote declined, mostly in the favour of the Swiss People's Party, and the party was reduced to one Federal Councillor at the 2003 election.
The party sits in the centre to centre-right of the political spectrum, advocating Christian democracy, the social market economy, and moderate social conservatism.  The party is strongest in Catholic rural areas, particularly Central Switzerland and Valais.
