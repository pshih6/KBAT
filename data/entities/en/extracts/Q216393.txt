Haaretz (Hebrew: הָאָרֶץ‎) (lit. "The Land [of Israel]", originally Ḥadashot Ha'aretz – Hebrew: חַדְשׁוֹת הָאָרֶץ‎, IPA: [χadaˈʃot haˈʔaʁets] – "News of the Land [of Israel]" in English The Palestine News) is an Israeli newspaper. It was founded in 1918, making it the longest running newspaper currently in print in Israel, and is now published in both Hebrew and English in the Berliner format. The English edition is published and sold together with the International New York Times. Both Hebrew and English editions can be read on the Internet. In North America, it is published as a weekly newspaper, combining articles from the Friday edition with a roundup from the rest of the week.
It is known for its left-wing and liberal stances on domestic and foreign issues. As of 2016, the newspaper had a weekday exposure rate of 3.9% in Israel. According to the Center for Research Libraries, among Israel's daily newspapers, "Haaretz is considered the most influential and respected for both its news coverage and its commentary."
