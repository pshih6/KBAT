Bernhardt Otto Holtermann (29 April 1838 â€“ 29 April 1885) was a successful gold miner, businessman, and politician in Australia. Perhaps his greatest claim to fame is his association with the Holtermann Nugget, the largest gold specimen ever found, 59 inches (1.5 m) long, weighing 630 pounds (290 kg), in Hill End, near Bathurst, and with an estimated gold content of 3,000 troy ounces (93 kg).
