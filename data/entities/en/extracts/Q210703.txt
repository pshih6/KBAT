The Israeli Labor Party (Hebrew: מִפְלֶגֶת הָעֲבוֹדָה הַיִּשְׂרְאֵלִית, translit. Mifleget HaAvoda HaYisrelit ), commonly known as HaAvoda (Hebrew: הָעֲבוֹדָה lit. "The Labor"), is a social democratic and Zionist political party in Israel. The party is currently under negotiations  with Blue and White to implement a merger. The party was established in 1968 by a merger of Mapai, Ahdut HaAvoda and Rafi. Until 1977, all Israeli Prime Ministers were affiliated with the Labor movement. The current party leader (since July 2019) is Amir Peretz.
The Labor Party is associated with supporting the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, pragmatic foreign affairs policies and social democratic economic policies. The party is a member of the Progressive Alliance and an observer member of the Party of European Socialists. The party was also a member of the Socialist International until suspending its membership in 2018 over the Socialist International's decision to join the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign.
