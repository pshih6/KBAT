Luca Turilli (born 5 March 1972) is an Italian musician (primarily a guitarist) and songwriter. He is one of the founders of the symphonic power metal band Rhapsody of Fire. He also worked on a trilogy of solo albums as Luca Turilli, and released one album under the name of Luca Turilli's Dreamquest, a project he worked on alongside Dominique Leurquin. In 2008, Luca began an online guitar course titled Luca Turilli's Neoclassical Revelation. The course takes its name from his neoclassical playing style.On every Rhapsody of Fire album, Luca is the only lyricist and composes all the music with the keyboardist, Alex Staropoli (except for Il Canto del Vento written, lyrics and music, by the vocalist, Fabio Lione) and plays most of the lead guitars. He composes all the music for both his solo projects. He plays guitars on his solo trilogy and keyboards with Luca Turilli's Dreamquest featuring Dominique Leurquin as the guitarist.
On August 2011, Turilli and Staropoli proceeded to a friendly split. Alex agreed to go on as Rhapsody of Fire, while Luca decided to move on as Luca Turilli's Rhapsody, adding his name on top of the logo because of trademark reasons and old legal settlements and stopping definitely the Luca Turilli band.
From November 2016 to March 2018, Turilli with his former bandmates Fabio Lione and Alex Holzwarth after their departures from Rhapsody of Fire, celebrated the 20th anniversary of Rhapsody's Symphony of Enchanted Lands album for the 20th Anniversary Farewell Tour.
In December 2018, it was announced that Turilli, Lione and former members of Rhapsody of Fire would be re-joining to record new material under the name "Turilli / Lione Rhapsody".
