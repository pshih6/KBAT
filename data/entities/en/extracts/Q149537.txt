A novella is a work of narrative prose fiction, longer than a short story but shorter than a novel.  Publishers and literary award societies typically consider a novella's word count to be between 15,000 and 40,000 words, although definitions vary.
The English word "novella" derives from the Italian novella, feminine of novello, which means "new". The novella is a common literary genre in several European languages.
