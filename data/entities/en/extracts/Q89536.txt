Roland Kickinger (born March 30, 1968) is an Austrian bodybuilder and actor from Vienna. Standing 6-feet-4-inches-tall (1,93 m) and weighing from 250-300 pounds (113 to 136 kg), he has appeared in numerous bodybuilding competitions, fitness magazines and training videos.
In his acting career, Kickinger is perhaps best known for his regular role as Chip Rommel in the television series Son of the Beach. He also played the young version of fellow Austrian-American, Arnold Schwarzenegger, in the 2005 TV movie See Arnold Run, which later led to him appearing in the 2009 film Terminator Salvation as a prototype of the T-800 (with Schwarzenegger's likeness digitally applied over his own). He also had minor roles in the films Street Warrior and Disaster Movie, both released in 2008.
