Edmund Heusinger von Waldegg (12 May 1817 â€“ 2 February 1886) was a German mechanical engineer and railway engineer.
Edmund Heusinger was born in Langenschwalbach (present day Bad Schwalbach) in the state of Hesse in central Germany on 12 May 1817. In 1841 he became a master-workman with the Taunus Railway (Taunusbahn). In 1854 he was awarded a contract to build the Homburg Railway. He invented inter alia a new type of valve gear for steam locomotives that was to become the most widely used valve gear in the world. Because the Belgian, Egide Walschaerts, invented the same system independently, it is usually called the Walschaerts valve gear outside the German-speaking world.
Edmund Heusinger von Waldegg died on 2 February 1886 in Hanover, in northern Germany.
