Absolute Beginners is a 1986 British musical film adapted from Colin MacInnes' book about life in late 1950s London, directed by Julien Temple. The film stars Eddie O' Connell, Patsy Kensit, James Fox, Edward Tudor-Pole, Anita Morris, and David Bowie, with featured appearances by Sade Adu, Ray Davies, and Steven Berkoff. It was screened out of competition at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival. It received immense coverage in the British media but was panned by critics and became a box office failure. However, Bowie's theme song was very popular in the UK, spending nine weeks on the charts and peaking at number two.The commercial failure of Absolute Beginners and two other films is blamed for the collapse of British film studio Goldcrest Films.
