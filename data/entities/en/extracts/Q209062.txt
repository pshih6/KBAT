The Socialist Republic of Croatia (Serbo-Croatian: Socijalistička Republika Hrvatska), commonly referred to as Socialist Croatia or simply Croatia, was a constituent republic and federated state of Yugoslavia and the nation state of Croats. By its constitution, modern-day Croatia is its direct continuation. 
Along with five other Yugoslav republics, it was formed during World War II and became a socialist republic after the war. It had four full official names during its 48-year existence (see below). By territory and population, it was the second largest republic in Yugoslavia, after the Socialist Republic of Serbia.
In 1990, the government dismantled the single-party system of government – installed by the Communist Party – and adopted a multi-party democracy. The newly elected government of Franjo Tuđman moved the republic towards independence, formally seceding from Yugoslavia in 1991 and thereby contributing to its dissolution.
