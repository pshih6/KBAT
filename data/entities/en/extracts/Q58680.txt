It is known in Persian literature as Afghani (افغانی, Afghāni), and in Hindustani literature as Paṭhānī. Speakers of the language are called Pashtuns or Pukhtuns/Pakhtuns (historically known as ethnic Afghans). Pashto and Dari (Persian) are the two official languages of Afghanistan. Pashto is also the second-largest regional language of Pakistan, mainly spoken in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and northern districts of Balochistan province in south-west.. Pashto is the primary language of the Pashtun diaspora around the world. The total number of Pashto-speakers is at least 40 million, although some estimates place it as high as 60 million.Pashto belongs to the Northeastern Iranian group of the Indo-Iranian branch, but Ethnologue lists it as Southeastern Iranian. Pashto has two main dialect groups, "soft" and "hard", the latter locally known as Pakhto or Paxto.
