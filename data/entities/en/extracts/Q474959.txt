In medicine, myalgia, also known as muscle pain or muscle ache, is a symptom that presents with a large array of diseases. While the most common cause is the overuse of a muscle or group of muscles, acute myalgia may also be due to viral infections, especially in the absence of a traumatic history. Longer-term myalgias may be indicative of a metabolic myopathy, some nutritional deficiencies, or chronic fatigue syndrome.
