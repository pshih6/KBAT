Drunken Master III is a 1994 Hong Kong martial arts film directed by Lau Kar-leung and starring Andy Lau, Michelle Reis, Willie Chi, Simon Yam, Lau Kar-leung, Adam Cheng and Gordon Liu. This film was quickly produced after director Lau and Jackie Chan fell out on the set of Drunken Master II with the style of action and Lau decided to produce a more authentic entry in the Drunken Master film series. Despite the title, Drunken Master III is not a sequel to the Drunken Master film series and is widely considered an imitator.
