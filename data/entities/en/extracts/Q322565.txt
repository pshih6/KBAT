Ian Donald  (27 December 1910 in Liskeard â€“ 19 June 1987) was an English physician and was most notable for pioneering the diagnostic use of ultrasound in obstetrics enabling the visual discovery of abnormalities in pregnancy. Donald was Regius Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Glasgow. Donald's work was characterised by a series of remarkable collaborations between clinicians and engineers that strove to build instruments to enable the examination of the unborn and that eventually enabled him to build the world's first obstetric ultrasound machine, the Diasonograph in 1963. His other great achievement was to secure the construction of the Queen Mother's Maternity Hospital that was built next to the Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow in Glasgow.
