Louis Charles Augustin Georges Trenet (French: [ʃaʁl tʁəne]; 18 May 1913 – 19 February 2001) was a French singer-songwriter, who composed both the music and the lyrics to nearly a thousand songs, which he sang to the exclusion of any others. These include "La Mer", "Boum!" and "Y'a d'la joie", and supported a career that lasted well over sixty years, despite periodic 'retirements'. His act was characterised by a jaunty air, touched with eccentricity, and he was sometimes known as the singing madman or the singing vagabond.
