Imre Augustich or Agostich (Slovene: Imre Augustič September 29/30, 1837 – July 17, 1879) was a Slovene writer, poet, journalist, and representative of Vas county in the National Assembly of Hungary. He was the author of Prijátel (Friend), the first newspaper in Prekmurje Slovene.
Augustich was born in Murski Petrovci (Prekmurje). His father, Lajos Augustich, was a petty nobleman and economic officer for the Szapáry family. His mother, Julianna Zanaty, was born in Szombathely. Augustich studied in Szombathely and Budapest, and early in his career was a notary for the Batthyány family in Murska Sobota and Alsószölnök, and became a reporter and journalist in Budapest.
The first works that Augustich wrote in Hungarian supported magyarization in the Slovene March. Augustich translated verses by Sándor Petőfi, János Arany, Pál Gyulai, and others, at the same time renewing Prekmurje Slovene language and literature.
He died of tuberculosis in Budapest.
