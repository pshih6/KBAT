Komputeko is an online project of the non-profit youth organization E@I (“Education@Internet”) with the goal of bringing together parallel computer terminology from various dictionaries in order to facilitate access to and comparison between different translations and thus promote exact use of language and counteract the (often sloppy) usage of linguistic borrowings from American English. Komputeko is short for the Esperanto noun phrase "Prikomputila terminokolekto", meaning "collection of computer terms". The dictionary is written in five languages (Esperanto, English, Dutch, German and French), and there are plans to expand it into other languages. A preliminary version with a few other languages already exists.
