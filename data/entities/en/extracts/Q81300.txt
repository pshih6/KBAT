François Baby (December 16, 1768 – August 27, 1852) was a French-Canadian businessman, soldier, and politician in Upper Canada. He was based in Detroit when it was still under the control of Great Britain and before it was ceded to the newly independent United States. After the British evacuated Fort Detroit in 1796, he moved with his family across the Detroit River and established residence in Sandwich (now Windsor, Ontario).
