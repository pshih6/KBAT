Joseph Marius Babo (January 14, 1756 in Ehrenbreitstein – February 5, 1822 in Munich). As a dramatist, Babo preferred action based on history. In Otto von Wittelsbach, written in 1781, he followed the path blazed by Goethe in Götz von Berlichingen. Sometimes one could see he was acquainted with Shakespeare. He filled a variety of pedagogical and bureaucratic roles related to the theater over his life.
