Marino Moretti (born Cesenatico, Italy; July 18, 1885 â€“ July 6, 1979) was an Italian poet and author.
Moretti's mother instilled in him a love of literature. After a failed attempt at an acting career, he began writing poetry; his first work being published in 1903. During his career, Moretti wrote twenty novels, eight books of verses, three book-length memoirs, and many short stories. Among his better known works are The Voice of God (1920) and Widow of Fioravanti (1971). Moretti's home in Italy has been turned into a museum.
