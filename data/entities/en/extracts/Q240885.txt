Sylvie Vartan (French pronunciation: ​[silvi vaʁtɑ̃]; born Sylvie Georges Vartanian, Bulgarian: Силви Жорж Вартанян; 15 August 1944 in Iskrets, Sofia Province) is a Bulgarian-French singer and actress. She is known as one of the most productive and tough-sounding yé-yé artists. Her performances often featured elaborate show-dance choreography, and she made many appearances on French and Italian TV.
Yearly shows with then-husband Johnny Hallyday attracted full houses at the Olympia and the Palais des congrès de Paris throughout the 1960s and mid-1970s. In 2004, after a break in performances, she began recording and giving concerts of jazz ballads in francophone countries.
