Step Up 3D (also known as Step Up 3) is a 2010 American 3D dance film written by Amy Andelson and Emily Meyer and directed by Step Up 2: The Streets's Jon M. Chu. The sequel sees the return of Adam Sevani and Alyson Stoner, who portrayed Moose from Step Up 2: The Streets and Camille Gage from Step Up. As the third installment in the Step Up series and the first shot in 3D, the film follows Moose and Camille Gage as they head to New York University, the former dancer of whom is majoring in electrical engineering after promising his father that he would not dance anymore. However, he soon stumbles upon a dance battle, meeting Luke Katcher and his House of Pirates dance crew and later teaming up with them to compete in the World Jam dance contest against their rival, the House of Samurai dance crew.
Step Up 3D premiered in Hollywood at the El Capitan Theater on August 2, 2010 and was subsequently released worldwide on August 6, 2010, through conventional 2D and 3D (in RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, and XpanD 3D) formats. It was also the second movie to feature the Dolby Surround 7.1 audio format theatrically, the first of which was Toy Story 3. The film grossed $15.8 million in its opening weekend, the lowest of the trilogy, but went on to make more money than any other installment in the series and has received generally mixed critical reviews, with most praise towards its dance sequences and effective use of 3D, while criticism went towards the repetitive story and acting.
