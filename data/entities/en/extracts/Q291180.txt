Mansfield Park is a 1999 British romantic comedy-drama film based on Jane Austen's novel of the same name, written and directed by Patricia Rozema. The film departs from the original novel in several respects. For example, the life of Jane Austen is incorporated into the film, as are the issues of slavery and plantation life. The majority of the film was made at Kirby Hall in Northamptonshire.
