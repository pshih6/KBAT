Sophia Charlotte von Kielmansegg, Countess of Darlington and Countess of Leinster (1675â€“1725) was a German-born courtier. A half-sister of George I of Great Britain, to whom she was close, she moved to England in 1714 shortly after the Hanoverian succession, where she became an influential figure of his court.
