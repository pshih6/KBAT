Ottoman Turkish (; Turkish: Osmanlı Türkçesi) or the Ottoman language (Ottoman Turkish: لسان عثمانى‎, lisân-ı Osmânî, also known as تركجه‎, Türkçe or تركی‎, Türkî, "Turkish"; Turkish: Osmanlıca), is the variety of the Turkish language used in the Ottoman Empire (14th to 20th centuries). It borrows extensively, in all aspects, from Arabic and Persian and its speakers used the (Perso-Arabic) Ottoman Turkish alphabet for written communications. During the peak of Ottoman power (c. 16th century CE), words of foreign origin in Turkish literature in the Ottoman empire heavily outnumbered native Turkish words, with Arabic and Persian vocabulary accounting for up to 88% of the Ottoman vocabulary in some texts.Consequently, Ottoman Turkish was largely unintelligible to the less-educated lower-class and to rural Turks, who continued to use kaba Türkçe ("raw/vulgar Turkish"; compare Vulgar Latin), which used far fewer foreign loanwords and is the basis of the modern Turkish language. The  Tanzimât era (1839-1876) saw the application of the term "Ottoman" when referring to the language  (لسان عثمانی‎, lisân-ı Osmânî or عثمانليجه‎, Osmanlıca); Modern Turkish makes the same distinction (Osmanlıca and Osmanlı Türkçesi).
