Simon Ove Christian Ogilvie Spies (1 September 1921 – 16 April 1984) was a famous Danish tycoon, best known for founding the charter airline Spies Rejser, and its airway company Conair of Scandinavia. Spies Rejser is today owned by Petter Stordalen.
Spies Rejser was opened in 1956 and would soon become a huge success along with the competitor Tjæreborg. In the beginning they arranged cheap bus/boattrips to Majorca, but later (in the early 1960s) Spies bought the bankrupt Danish charter operator Flying Enterprise and formed his own airline, Conair of Scandinavia.
Simon Spies was known for his provocative views and flamboyant lifestyle. He was famous for employing at his private residence so-called morgenbolledamer, or morning fuck ladies / morning bun ladies, using the pun that "bolle" means both "fuck" and "bun".
When going to the theatre he would usually buy three tickets, leaving one seat for his cane and one for his dog Archibald.
On 11 May 1983, he married Janni Brodersen, who inherited his companies when he died less than a year later. In 2013, a movie about his career was made.
