Chantharath was the second son of Manthathurath. He succeeded his elder brother Sukkhasoem in 1852. During his reign, the kingdom confronted by serious local, regional, and international threats. In 1864, Haw rebels raided the country. He freed Principality of Xiangkhouang (Muang Phuan) from Vietnamese and Haw rebels. In 1828, the Siamese king Mongkut returned the Phra Bang Buddha to Luang Phrabang. He died in 1870. Later, his brother Oun Kham succeeded.
