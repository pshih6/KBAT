Maurizio Gucci (September 26, 1948 â€“ March 27, 1995), son of Rodolfo Gucci and grandson of Guccio Gucci, was an Italian businessman, and the one-time head of the Gucci fashion house. 
Maurizio Gucci went on to sell his stock in Gucci in 1993 for $170 million to the Bahrain-based investment group, Investcorp. In 1995, a year and a half after the sale of Gucci, he was gunned down by a hired hit man. His ex-wife Patrizia Reggiani was later convicted of arranging the killing.
