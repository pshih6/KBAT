Hugo is a 2011 American adventure drama film with steampunk influences directed and produced by Martin Scorsese, and adapted for the screen by John Logan. Based on Brian Selznick's book The Invention of Hugo Cabret, it tells the story of a boy who lives alone in the Gare Montparnasse railway station in Paris in the 1930s.
Hugo is Scorsese's first film shot in 3D, about which the filmmaker remarked, "I found 3D to be really interesting, because the actors were more upfront emotionally. Their slightest move, their slightest intention is picked up much more precisely." The film was released in the United States on November 23, 2011.Hugo received critical acclaim and 11 Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture), more than any other film that year, and it won five awards: Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Visual Effects. It was also nominated for eight BAFTAs, and won two of the eight, and was nominated for three Golden Globe awards, earning Scorsese his third Golden Globe Award for Best Director. Despite the acclaim and accolades, the film was a box office bomb, which grossed $185 million against its $150â€“$170 million budget.
