Dorothée (French pronunciation of the first name Dorothy) is the stage name of Frédérique Hoschedé (born 14 July 1953 in Paris), a French singer and television presenter. She was a continuity announcer on French public broadcaster Antenne 2 from 1977 to 1983, but she is best known for having presented children's television shows like Les mercredis de la jeunesse (Childhood's Wednesdays, 1973), Dorothée et ses amis (Dorothée and Her Friends, 1977–1978), Récré A2 (Recess A2, 1978–1987), and especially Club Dorothée (Dorothée's Club, 1987–1997), which totalled up to about 30 hours of broadcast per week and popularized Japanese animation in France (with titles like Dragon Ball, Saint Seiya, City Hunter or Hokuto no Ken, sparking controversy and complaints from the CSA as well as some political figures for their violent content).
She is also a singer with a large discography (one album per year on average between 1980 and 1996), singing pop music for children, and she has also recorded the best-known French traditional nursery rhymes in a record collection called Le jardin des chansons (Garden of Songs). Several of her songs were used for the opening of animated series featured in the Club Dorothée (including Candy, Sophie et Virginie). One of her trademarks is that each of her albums, starting from Hou ! la menteuse in 1982 and up until Dorothée 2010, featured a song with the word "valise" (suitcase) in its title, with a similar melody but a different arrangement and partially updated lyrics, totalling 16 "valise" songs.
Between 1990 and 1996 she did 56 shows at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy (now called AccorHotels Arena), which is still the record for a female artist, and the third global performance for the total number of concerts in this venue behind Michel Sardou and Johnny Hallyday. Besides, her 1992 tour attracted more people in France than Johnny Hallyday and Michael Jackson, earning her a "Fauteuil d'Or" award for more than 500.000 tickets sold.
Later in her musical career Dorothée developed a particular interest for early rock music. In 1993 and 1994 she animated three special prime-time shows called Dorothée Rock'n'roll Show, in which she sang duets with major rock and roll and rhythm and blues artists like Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Cliff Richard, Henri Salvador, Percy Sledge, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis with whom she sang Great Balls of Fire, also featured on her album Une histoire d'amour (1992). Her 1994 album Nashville Tennessee was recorded in the titular Nashville city, in the recording studio made famous by Elvis Presley and Bill Haley.
She had a brief stint in cinema, appearing in three movies between 1979 and 1980, including a prominent role in L'amour en fuite by François Truffaut. The also made a cameo appearance in the 2019 live action Nicky Larson movie.
