Herbert Jankuhn (born 8 August 1905 in Angerburg, East Prussia – 30 April 1990 in Göttingen) was a German archaeologist and Nazi Party official, rising to the rank of SS-Sturmbannführer by January 1944. He oversaw a series of excavations on behalf of the SS-Ahnenerbe, as well as fulfilling intelligence assignments near the end of the war. After an appealed Denazification trial cleared him of all charges in 1949, he was professionally rehabilitated and went on to become one of post-war Germany's leading archaeology academics.
