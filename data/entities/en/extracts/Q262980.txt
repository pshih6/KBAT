Harper (released in the UK as The Moving Target) is a 1966 American Technicolor mystery film in Panavision based on Ross Macdonald's novel The Moving Target and adapted for the screen by novelist William Goldman, who admired MacDonald's writings. The film stars Paul Newman as Lew Harper (Lew Archer in the novel). It is directed by Jack Smight, with an ensemble cast that includes Robert Wagner, Julie Harris, Janet Leigh, Shelley Winters and Arthur Hill.
Goldman received a 1967 Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay.
The film pays homage to Humphrey Bogart's portrayals of Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe by featuring Bogart's widow, Lauren Bacall, who plays a wounded wife searching for her missing husband, a role similar to General Sternwood in the 1946 Bogart-and-Bacall film, The Big Sleep.
In 1975, Newman reprised the role in The Drowning Pool.
