Tales of the City (formally Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City) is a 1993 television miniseries based on the first of the Tales of the City series of novels by Armistead Maupin.
To date, the first three books have been adapted into television miniseries; the first, Tales of the City, was produced by the UK's Channel 4 and was first screened in the UK in 1993, then shown on PBS in the US in January 1994. Channel 4 eventually teamed up with the American cable network Showtime to produce the sequel, More Tales of the City, which premiered in the US and UK in 1998.  The third installment of the series, Further Tales of the City, was produced by Showtime (without Channel 4) and was originally aired in the US on Showtime in May 2001.
A fourth installment, Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, premiered on Netflix on June 7, 2019, with Laura Linney, Olympia Dukakis and Paul Gross reprising their roles.
