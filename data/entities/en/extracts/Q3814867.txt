Kevyn James Aucoin (February 14, 1962 â€“ May 7, 2002) was an American make-up artist, photographer and author. In the 1990s, Aucoin was wholly responsible for the "sculpted" look of many celebrities and top models, including Whitney Houston, Cher, Madonna, Cindy Crawford, and Naomi Campbell. He published a number of industry defining cosmetics books, which are now widely accepted as introducing makeup contouring to the general public for the first time.
