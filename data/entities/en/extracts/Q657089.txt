The Workers' Party (Portuguese: Partido dos Trabalhadores, PT) is a political party in Brazil. Some scholars classify its ideology as social democracy. Founded in 1980, it is one of the largest parties in Latin America. PT governed at the federal level in a coalition government with several other parties from 1 January 2003 to 31 August 2016. After the 2002 parliamentary election, PT became the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies and the largest in the Federal Senate for the first time With the highest approval rating in the history of the country, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is PT's most prominent member. His successor Dilma Rousseff, also a member of PT, took office on 1 January 2011 and was impeached in 2016.
Both born among the opposition to the coup d'état of 1964 and the subsequent military dictatorship, PT and the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) from 1994 to 2014 were the biggest adversaries in contemporary Brazilian politics, with their candidates finishing either first or second on the ballot on the last six presidential elections. Both parties generally prohibit any kind of coalition or official cooperation with each other.
Despite its relatively large number of supporters, the party has been involved in a number of corruption scandals since Lula first came to power and saw its popular support plummet between 2010 and 2016, with presidential approval ratings falling from over 80% to 9%. The party's symbols are the red flag with a white star in the center; the five-pointed red star, inscribed with the initials PT in the center; and the Workers Party's anthem. Workers' Party's TSE (Superior Electoral Court) Identification Number is 13.
