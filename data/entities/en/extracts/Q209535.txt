Dmitry I (Russian: Димитрий I (Первый), tr. Dimitry I (Perviy)) (historically known as Pseudo-Demetrius I and False Dmitry I, Russian: Лжедмитрий I, tr. Lzhedmitry I) was the Tsar of Russia from 10 June 1605 until his death on 17 May 1606 under the name of Dmitry Ivanovich (Russian: Дмитрий Иванович). According to historian Chester S.L. Dunning, Dmitry was "the only Tsar ever raised to the throne by means of a military campaign and popular uprisings".He was the first, and most successful, of three "pretenders" (Russian: самозванцы (sing.: самозванец), romanized: samozvanets) who claimed during the Time of Troubles to be the youngest son of Ivan the Terrible, tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich, who had supposedly escaped a 1591 assassination attempt. It is generally believed that the real Dmitry died in Uglich.
