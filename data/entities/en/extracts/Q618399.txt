The Republic of the Congo (French: République du Congo) was a sovereign state in Central Africa that was created with the independence of the Belgian Congo in 1960. From 1960 to 1966, the country was often known as Congo-Léopoldville (after its capital) in order to distinguish it from its north-western neighbor, also called the Republic of the Congo or Congo-Brazzaville. With the renaming of Léopoldville as Kinshasa on 1 June 1966, it was known as Congo-Kinshasa until 1971.
On 1 August 1964, the state's official name was changed to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 1971, the state's name changed to Zaire.
The period between 1960 and 1965 is referred to as the First Congolese Republic, while the current Democratic Republic of the Congo is referred to as the Third Republic.
Unrest and rebellion continued to plague the government until 1965, when Lieutenant General Joseph Désiré Mobutu, commander-in-chief of the national army, seized control of the country. Mobutu changed the country's official name to the Republic of Zaire in 1971 and remained its president until 1997.
