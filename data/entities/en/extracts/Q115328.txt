Abelardo Rodríguez Luján, commonly known as Abelardo L. Rodríguez (Spanish pronunciation: [aβeˈlaɾðo ˈele roˈðɾiɣes]; May 12, 1889 – February 13, 1967) was the substitute president of Mexico from 1932 to 1934. He completed the term of Pascual Ortiz Rubio after his resignation, during the period known as the Maximato. Former President Plutarco Elías Calles  (el jefe Máximo) then held considerable de facto political power, without being president himself. However, Rodríguez was more successful than his predecessor Ortiz Rubio in asserting presidential power against Calles's influence.
