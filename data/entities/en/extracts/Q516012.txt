Naoki Hattori (服部 尚貴, born June 13, 1966 in Tokyo) is a motoring journalist and racing driver from Japan.
After he won the Japanese Formula 3 championship in 1990, he failed to pre-qualify for two Formula One grands prix with Coloni in 1991 as a late-season replacement for Pedro Chaves.  He raced in Indy Lights in the mid-90s, and in CART briefly in 1999 for Walker Racing with a best finish of 14th. In 1997, he tested a Formula One prototype, the F105, for Dome F1 at Suzuka and other Japanese race tracks, but Dome F1 never entered a Formula One Grand Prix.
Hattori competed regularly at the Japanese Touring Car Championship, winning the 1996 title with a Mooncraft Honda Accord after collecting five wins and three second-place finishes in 12 starts.
In 1991 driving a Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R for Nismo, Hattori, David Brabham and Anders Olofsson won the Spa 24 Hours.
He is not related to compatriot and fellow racer Shigeaki Hattori. He has been one of the presenters of the Best Motoring video series.
