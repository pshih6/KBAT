Italy of Values (Italian: Italia dei Valori, IdV) is a centrist, populist, and anti-corruption political party in Italy. The party was founded in 1998 by former Mani pulite prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro, who entered politics in 1996 and finally left the party in 2014. IdV has aimed at gathering and giving voice to different sectors of the Italian society. From the beginning of its existence one of its major issues has been the so-called "moral issue". However, in early 2010s IdV was eclipsed by the new-born Five Star Movement, founded by comedian Beppe Grillo, which used the same populist and anti-corruption rhetoric.
