Death by burning is an execution method involving combustion or exposure to extreme heat. It has a long history as a form of capital punishment, and many societies have employed it for criminal activities such as treason, heresy and witchcraft. The best known execution of this type is burning at the stake where the condemned is bound to a large wooden stake and a fire lit beneath them.
