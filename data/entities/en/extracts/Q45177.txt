The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) is a program of the US government that allows citizens of specific countries to travel to the United States for tourism, business, or while in transit for up to 90 days without having to obtain a visa. The program applies to the 50 states and District of Columbia, as well as Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, with limited application to other US territories.
All of the countries selected by the US government to be in the program are high-income economies with a very high Human Development Index that are generally regarded as developed countries.
