Johannes Piscator (; German: Johannes Fischer; 27 March 1546 â€“ 26 July 1625) was a German Reformed theologian, known as a Bible translator and textbook writer.
He was a prolific writer, and initially moved around as he held a number of positions. Some scholarly confusion as to whether there was more than one person of the name was addressed in a paper by Walter Ong.
