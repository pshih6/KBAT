GroenLinks (Dutch pronunciation: [ɣrunˈlɪŋks]; English: GreenLeft, GL) is a green political party in the Netherlands. It was formed on 1 March 1989 from the merger of four left-wing parties: the Communist Party of the Netherlands, the Pacifist Socialist Party, the Political Party of Radicals and the Evangelical People's Party.
After disappointing results in the 1989 and 1994 general elections, the nascent party fared particularly well in the 1998 and 2002 elections. The party's leader at that time, Paul Rosenmöller, was seen as the unofficial Leader of the Opposition against the First Kok cabinet, a purple government.
GroenLinks describes itself as "green", "social" and "tolerant". The party holds 14 seats in the House of Representatives, 8 in the Senate and 3 in the European Parliament. The current Leader of GroenLinks and chair of the House parliamentary group is Jesse Klaver. The party is in opposition against the governing Third Rutte cabinet. The party has over 100 local councillors and it participates in the government of sixteen of the twenty largest municipalities. The party's voters are concentrated in larger cities, especially those with a university.
The party has 21,901 members which are organised in over 250 municipal branches. The party congress is open to all members. GroenLinks is a member of the Global Greens and the European Green Party. The party's number of seats fell from 10 to 4 seats in the 2012 election, before increasing to 14 in the 2017 general election.
