New wave is a form of rock music encompassing numerous pop-oriented music styles popular in the late 1970s and the 1980s. It is rooted in mid-1970s punk rock. New wave moved away from traditional blues and rock and roll sounds to create pop/rock music that incorporated disco, mod and electronic music. It engendered subgenres and fusions, including synth-pop.New wave differs from other movements with ties to first-wave punk, as it displays characteristics common to pop music rather than the more "artsy" post-punk. Although it incorporates much of the original punk rock sound and ethos, new wave exhibits greater complexity in both music and lyrics. Common characteristics of new wave music include the use of synthesizers and electronic productions, and a distinctive visual style featured in music videos and fashion.New wave was promoted heavily by MTV (the Buggles' "Video Killed the Radio Star" was broadcast as the first music video to promote the channel's launch). The popularity of several new wave artists is often attributed to their exposure on the channel. In the mid-1980s, differences between new wave and other music genres began to blur. New wave has enjoyed resurgences since the 1990s after a rising nostalgia for several new wave-influenced artists. During the 2000s, a number of acts explored new wave and post-punk influences and were sometimes labeled "new wave of new wave".
