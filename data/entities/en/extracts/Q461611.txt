Amelia Sarah Levetus (1853â€“1938) was a British-Austrian art historian, journalist, educator and feminist. After moving to Austria in 1891, she became the first woman to lecture at the University of Vienna when in February 1897 she gave two public lectures on Britain's cooperative movement. Soon afterwards she concentrated on the history of art, especially modern art. In 1898 she founded a school in Vienna, based on those in England, with a focus on art and the English language. In addition to her contributions to art journals, she published a number of books on Austrian art.
