King Solomon Hill is the name assigned to a blues singer and guitarist who recorded a handful of songs in 1932. His unique guitar and voice make them among the most haunting blues recorded. After much speculation and dispute, he has been identified as Joe Holmes (1897, McComb, Mississippi â€“ 1949, Sibley, Louisiana), a self-taught guitarist from Mississippi.
