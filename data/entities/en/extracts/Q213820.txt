Henri Fayol (29 July 1841 â€“ 19 November 1925) was a French mining engineer, mining executive, author and director of mines who developed general theory of business administration that is often called Fayolism. He and his colleagues developed this theory independently of scientific management but roughly contemporaneously. Like his contemporary, he is widely acknowledged as a founder of modern management method.
