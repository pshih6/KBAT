Daniel Leopold Wildenstein (11 September 1917 â€“ 23 October 2001) was a French art dealer, historian and owner-breeder of thoroughbred race horses.  He was the third member of the family to preside over Wildenstein & Co., one of the most successful and influential art-dealerships of the 20th century.  He was once described as "probably the richest and most powerful art dealer on earth".
