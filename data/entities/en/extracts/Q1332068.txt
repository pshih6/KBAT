The French Section of the Workers' International (French: Section française de l'Internationale ouvrière, SFIO) was a French socialist party founded in 1905 and replaced in 1969 by the current Socialist Party (PS). It was created during the 1905 Globe Congress in Paris as a merger between the French Socialist Party and the Socialist Party of France in order to create the French section of the Second International, designated as the party of the workers' movement.
The SFIO was led by Jules Guesde, Jean Jaurès (who quickly became its most influential figure), Édouard Vaillant and Paul Lafargue and united the Marxist tendency represented by Guesde with the social-democratic tendency represented by Jaurès. The SFIO opposed itself to colonialism and to militarism, although it abandoned its anti-militarist views and supported the National Union government (Union nationale) facing Germany's declaration of war on France in World War I.
Having replaced internationalist class struggle with patriotism like the whole Second International and because of conflicting views towards the 1917 Russian Revolution and the Bolshevik-led Third International, the SFIO split into two groups during the 1920 Tours Congress as the majority created the Section française de l'Internationale communiste (SFIC) which joined the Third International and became the French Communist Party while the minority continued as the SFIO.
