Chatham ( CHAT-É™m) is one of the Medway towns located within the Medway unitary authority, in North Kent, in South East England.
The town developed around Chatham Dockyard and several Army barracks, together with 19th-century forts which provided a defensive shield for the dockyard. The Corps of Royal Engineers is still based in Chatham at Brompton Barracks. 
The Dockyard closed in 1984, but the remaining major naval buildings are an attraction for a flourishing tourist industry. Following closure, part of the site was developed as a commercial port, other parts were redeveloped for business and residential use, and part was used as the Chatham Historic Dockyard museum. Its attractions include the submarine HMS Ocelot. 
The town has important road links and the railway and bus stations are the main interchanges for the area.  It is the administrative headquarters of Medway unitary authority, as well as its principal shopping centre.
