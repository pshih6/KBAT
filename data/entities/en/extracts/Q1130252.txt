A sporting director, or director of sport, is an executive management position in a body concerned with sport. The role is best known as a manager role at continental European football clubs, which are usually "sports clubs" offering many types of sports. While the coach takes care of the team in daily work, the manager or sporting director takes care of hiring the team. The sporting director is, in many cases, a member of the executive board and therefore an executive director.
In English football clubs both roles, director of sports and coach, are united into one person, the manager. In addition to a sporting director or manager, big clubs in rare cases also appoint a director of football, like Paris Saint-Germain or Everton. The director of football is usually not a member of the board.
