Dame Maria Paula Figueiroa Rego  (born 26 January 1935) is a Portuguese-born visual artist who is particularly known for her paintings and prints based on storybooks. Regoâ€™s style has evolved from abstract towards representational, and she has favoured pastels over oils for much of her career. Her work often reflects feminism, coloured by folk-themes from her native Portugal.
Rego studied at the Slade School of Fine Art, University College London and was an exhibiting member of the London Group, along with David Hockney and Frank Auerbach. She was the first artist-in-residence at the National Gallery in London . She lives and works in London.
