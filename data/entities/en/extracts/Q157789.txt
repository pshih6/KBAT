Frederick I (7 October 1471 â€“ 10 April 1533) was the king of Denmark and Norway.  His name is also spelled Frederik in Danish and Norwegian,   
Friedrich in German and Fredrik in Swedish. He was the last Roman Catholic monarch to reign over Denmark, when subsequent monarchs embraced Lutheranism after the Protestant Reformation. As king of Norway, Frederick is most remarkable in never having visited the country and was never crowned as such.  Therefore, he was styled  King of Denmark, the Vends and the Goths, elected King of Norway.
