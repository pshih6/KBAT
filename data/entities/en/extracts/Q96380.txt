Michael Succow (born 21 April 1941 in LÃ¼dersdorf near Bad Freienwalde) is a German biologist and ecologist. His numerous publications are mostly devoted to the ecology of moorlands and his typology of moorlands is today used as a standard classifications strategy for moorlands.
In 1997, he was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for his work, particularly his efforts to create nature reserves in Germany, Eastern Europe and Asia. In 2015, Succow was awarded the honorary German Environmental Award of the German Federal Environmental Foundation, Europe's highest endowed environmental prize.
