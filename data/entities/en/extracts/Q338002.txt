The Inglorious Bastards (Italian: Quel maledetto treno blindato, literally: "That damned armored train") is a 1978 Italian action/war film directed by Enzo G. Castellari, written by Sandro Continenza, Sergio Grieco, Franco Marotta, Romano Migliorini, and Laura Toscano, and starring Bo Svenson, Peter Hooten, Fred Williamson, Michael Pergolani, and Jackie Basehart. The film score was written by Francesco De Masi. The film, which concerns a group of prisoners who are drafted into a special war mission in 1944, is a loose remake of the 1967 American film The Dirty Dozen.
The film attracted critics' attention again after Quentin Tarantino used the title as the inspiration for the title of his 2009 film Inglourious Basterds. The Tarantino film is not a remake of The Inglorious Bastards, but contains a few references to it, including the appearance of actor Bo Svenson as an American colonel.
