After earning a first prize for comedy at the National Conservatory of Dramatic Art in 1928, she became the first resident of Comédie-French. She resigned to become the partner of Pierre Fresnay in the boulevard theaters of the time, before returning to the Comédie-French circuit in April 1952, and remaining until its end in December 1973. She then went on to play with the Renaud-Barrault Company until her retirement a year later. At the Comédie-French, she staged several plays of Marivaux. She was also an election interpreter.
