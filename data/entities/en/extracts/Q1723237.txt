The Kamor is a mountain in the Appenzell Alps and has an elevation of 1,751 m above the sea. It is part of a mountain belt which forms the western boundary of the Rhine Valley and is located on the border of the Swiss cantons Appenzell Innerrhoden and Canton of St. Gallen.
Less than one kilometre to the south is the Hoher Kasten, a 1,794 m high mountain accessible via an aerial tramway. Both mountains are separated by the Kamorsattel, a 1,678 m high saddle.

On top of the Kamor is a wooden summit cross erected by the section Kamor of the Swiss Alpine Club.
Ascents to Kamor and Hoher Kasten were already described in the early 19th century.
