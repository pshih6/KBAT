Denis Sefton Delmer (24 May 1904 – 4 September 1979) was a British journalist of Australian heritage and, during World War II, a propagandist for the British government. Fluent in German, he became friendly with Ernst Röhm who arranged for him to interview Adolf Hitler in 1931. During hostilities he led a black propaganda campaign against Hitler by radio from England, so successfully that he was named in the Nazis' Black Book for immediate arrest after their planned invasion of Britain.
