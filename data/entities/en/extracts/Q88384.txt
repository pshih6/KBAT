Hugo Gustav Adolf Stoltzenberg (27 April 1883 – 14 January 1974) was a German chemist associated with the German government's clandestine chemical warfare activities in the early 1920s.
Stoltzenberg was a close collaborator of Nobel Prize laureate Fritz Haber, the father of German chemical warfare. They both collaborated in the disposal of chemical warfare materials and the building of manufacturing plants in La Marañosa, near Madrid, Spain, the Soviet Union and Germany.
