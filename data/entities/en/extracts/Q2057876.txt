The Academia Argentina de Letras is the academy in charge of studying and prescribing the use of the Spanish language in Argentina. Since its establishment, on August 13, 1931, it has maintained ties with the Royal Spanish Academy and the other Spanish-language academies that are members to the Association of Spanish Language Academies. Since 1999, it has officially been a correspondent academy. It currently comprises 24 full members, elected because of their significant backgrounds on language-related works, or literature studies. They make up the directing body of the academy, and they are capable of electing honorary and correspondent academic members.
