Jenő Rejtő (Jenő Reich; 1905–1943; pseudonyms: P. Howard, Gibson Lavery) was a Hungarian journalist, pulp fiction writer and playwright who died as a forced labourer during World War II. He was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary, on March 29, 1905, and died in Evdakovo, Voronezh Oblast, Soviet Union (then under Axis occupation) on January 1, 1943. Despite the "pulp" nature of his writings, he is not only widely read in Hungary, but is also much appreciated by literary critics. It is a prevalent opinion that he lifted the genre to the level of serious art, and his works will long outlive him.
