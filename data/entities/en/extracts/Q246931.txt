Abraham Michael "Abe" Rosenthal (May 2, 1922 – May 10, 2006) was an American journalist who served as The New York Times executive editor from 1977 to 1988, having served previously as the city editor and managing editor. At the end of his tenure as executive editor, he became a columnist (1987–1999) and New York Daily News columnist (1999–2004).
He joined The New York Times in 1943 and remained there for 56 years, to 1999. Rosenthal won a Pulitzer Prize in 1960 for international reporting. As an editor at the newspaper, Rosenthal oversaw the coverage of a number of major news stories including the Vietnam War (1961–1975), the Pentagon Papers (1971), and the Watergate scandal (1972–1974). He was instrumental in the paper's coverage of the 1964 Kitty Genovese murder case, which was widely influential and established the concept of the "bystander effect", but later came to be regarded as flawed and misleading.
Together with Catherine A. Fitzpatrick, he was the first Westerner to visit a Soviet Gulag camp in 1988. His son, Andrew Rosenthal, was The Times editorial page editor from 2007 to 2016.
