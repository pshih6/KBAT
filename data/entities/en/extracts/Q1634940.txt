The Nakhchivan Khanate (Persian: خانات نخجوان‎ — Khānāt-e Nakhchevān)  was a khanate that was established in Afsharid Persia in 1747. The territory of the khanate corresponded to most of the present-day Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic and Vayots Dzor Province of present-day Armenia. It was named after its chief settlement, the town of Nakhchivan.
