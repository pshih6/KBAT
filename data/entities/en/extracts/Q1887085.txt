John Christopher Hawken (born 9 May 1940 in Bournemouth) is an English keyboard player. He studied classical piano between the ages of four and eighteen at which point he succumbed to the lure of rock and roll. Hawken's first band was the Cruisers Rock Combo (1960 to 1962) but he is possibly best known for his contributions to various versions of The Nashville Teens (1962 to 1968). He was then a founding member of Renaissance in 1969.
He also played in Spooky Tooth, Third World War, Vinegar Joe, Strawbs and Illusion, as well as being a session musician.
