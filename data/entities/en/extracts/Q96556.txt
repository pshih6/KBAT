After being released from captivity after the war, he became a documentary maker.   With over 120 films, he was among the most productive documentary directors of the GDR, and produced DEFA documentaries. He had the idea for the DEFA long term documentary "Die Kinder von Golzow" (The children of Golzow). He was born in Mannheim and died in Kleinmachnow, aged 91. According to Frank Pergande, Gass was "one of the most influential propagandists" of the state.
