Chrétien de Troyes (Modern French: [kʁetjɛ̃ də tʁwa]; 1135?–1185?, fl. c. 1160–1191) was a French poet and trouvère known for his writing on Arthurian subjects, and for possibly originating the character of Lancelot. Chrétien's works, including Erec and Enide, Lancelot, Perceval, and Yvain, represent some of the best-regarded of medieval literature. His use of structure, particularly in Yvain, has been seen as a step towards the modern novel.
