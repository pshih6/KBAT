Pietro Fenoglio (Turin, 3 May 1865 - Corio, 22 August 1927) was an Italian architect and engineer, considered one of the most important pioneers of Art Nouveau in Italy.
Fenoglio quickly grasped the ascendancy of Art Nouveau as it appeared in Italy at the turn of the century as the "Stile Floreale" or "Stile Liberty" (Liberty style, named after the British department store Liberty & Company, a major purveyor of Art Nouveau furniture and decorative arts), during a period when Italian architects were searching for a national style of modern architecture. He took advantage of the very favorable economic climate to become one of the style's most fervent supporters in northern Italy before the First World War. Building little after 1912, Fenoglio parlayed his success as a designer into a diverse set of economic ventures, eventually landing him the directorship of a bank in 1915.
