Jakob Heller (c. 1460, Frankfurt am Main — 28 January 1522, Frankfurt am Main) was a German patrician, politician, and merchant. He served as Senior Bürgermeister of the Free City of Frankfurt in 1501 and 1513. Heller is best remembered today as a patron of the arts, as he commissioned the Heller Altarpiece from Albrecht Dürer and Matthias Grünewald, and a large sculpture of the crucifixion from Hans Backoffen.
