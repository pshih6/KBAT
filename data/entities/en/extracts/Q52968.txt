Erik Gustaf Bernhard Boström (11 February 1842 – 21 February 1907) was a Swedish landowner and politician who was a member of the Swedish Parliament (1876–1907) and the longest-serving Prime Minister of Sweden of the 19th century. He served twice, first from 1891 to 1900 and then again from 1902 to 1905. He was also known as E.G. Boström or E. Gust. Boström.
In 1871, he married Carolina "Lina" Almqvist, with whom he had six daughters and one son. Brother of County Governor Filip Boström and nephew of the philosopher Christopher Jacob Boström.
Boström’s governmental policy was marked by its pragmatism. Over time, Boström gained a good reputation as being a rallying national icon despite being the first prime minister to have neither an academic education nor experience with upper governmental positions. He was also quite popular with King Oscar II. Boström’s eventual downfall was caused by his refusal to budge on the issue of Norway.
