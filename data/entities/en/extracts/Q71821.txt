Heinz Ellenberg (1 August 1913 in Harburg (Elbe) – 2 May 1997 in Göttingen) was a German biologist, botanist and ecologist.  Ellenberg was an advocate of viewing ecological systems through holistic means. He developed 9–point scales for rating European plant preferences for light, temperature, continentality (geographic region), nutrients, soil moisture, pH, and salinity.
