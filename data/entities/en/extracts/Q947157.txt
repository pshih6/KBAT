Gabriel Hanot (6 November 1889 – 10 August 1968) was a French footballer and journalist (the editor of L'Équipe). The European Cup – which became the UEFA Champions League – was the brainchild of Hanot, as was the Ballon d'Or, an award that honours the male player deemed to have performed the best over the previous year.
