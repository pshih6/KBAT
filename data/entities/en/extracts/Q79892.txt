It is the eighth-most populated city in the state outside the Chicago metropolitan area, and the most-populated city in the state south of Springfield. It is the county seat of St. Clair County, and the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Belleville and the National Shrine of Our Lady of the Snows.
