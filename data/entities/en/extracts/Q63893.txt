Paul Carell (born Paul Karl Schmidt; 2 November 1911, Kelbra â€“ 20 June 1997) was a German propagandist who was the chief press spokesman for Joachim von Ribbentrop's Foreign Ministry during the Nazi era. In this capacity during World War II, he maintained close ties with the Wehrmacht, while he served in the Allgemeine-SS (General SS). One of his specialities was the "Jewish question". After the war, Carell became a successful author, although critics claim that his books romanticized and whitewashed the Wehrmacht.
