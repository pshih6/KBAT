Mafia!, also known as Jane Austen's Mafia!, is a 1998 comedy film directed by Jim Abrahams and starring Jay Mohr, Lloyd Bridges (in one of his final films), Olympia Dukakis and Christina Applegate.
The film spoofs Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather series and various other mafia films, notably Martin Scorsese's Casino. It also parodies films in other genres, ranging from Forrest Gump to Il Postino and The English Patient.
