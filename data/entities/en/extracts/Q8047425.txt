The Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science is the engineering school of Yale University. When the first professor of civil engineering was hired in 1852, a Yale School of Engineering was established within the Yale Scientific School, and in 1932 the engineering faculty organized as a separate, constituent school of the university. The school offers undergraduate and graduate classes and degrees in electrical engineering, chemical engineering, computer science, environmental engineering, biomedical engineering, and mechanical engineering and materials science.
