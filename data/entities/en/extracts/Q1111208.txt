Zaynab bint Ali (Arabic: زَيْنَب ٱبْنَت عَلِيّ‎, Zaynab ibnat ʿAlīy), also spelled Zainab, was the daughter of Ali ibn Abi Talib  and Fatimah bint Muhammad. The Islamic Prophet Muhammad was her maternal grandfather, and thus she is a member of his Ahl al-Bayt. She is often revered not only for her characteristics and actions, but also for her membership in, and continuation of, the biological line of Muhammad. Like other members of her family, she is considered to be a figure of sacrifice, strength, and piety in both the Sunni and Shia sects of Islam. 
Zaynab married ‘Abdullah ibn Ja‘far and had four sons and one daughter with him. When her brother, Husayn, fought against Yazid ibn Mu‘awiyah in 680 CE (AH 61), Zaynab accompanied him. She played an important role in protecting her nephew, ‘Ali ibn Al-Husayn, and because of this, she became known as the "Heroine of Karbala". Zaynab died in 681 CE, and her mosque is located in Damascus, Syria.
