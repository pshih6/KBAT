Epsom () is a market town in Surrey, England, 13.7 miles (22.0 km) southwest of London, between Ashtead and Ewell. The town straddles chalk downland (Epsom Downs) and the upper Thanet Formation.  Epsom Downs Racecourse holds The Derby, now a generic name for sports competitions in English-speaking countries.  The town also gives its name to Epsom salts, originally extracted from mineral waters there.
