The Academy of Fine Arts Vienna (German: Akademie der bildenden KÃ¼nste Wien) is a public art school of higher education in Vienna, Austria. The Academy is famous outside the arts community for rejecting Adolf Hitler twice (in 1907 and 1908), because of his "unfitness for painting" (see also, Paintings by Adolf Hitler).
