The story begins five weeks before Christmas and is played out in a weekly countdown until the holiday, followed by an epilogue that takes place one month later.  It is an international co-production between the United Kingdom, United States, and France.The film was released in the United States on 14 November 2003, receiving mixed reviews. It opened in the United Kingdom one week later, to positive reviews. The film was a box-office success, grossing $248 million worldwide on a budget of $40–45 million. It received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. Frequently shown during the Christmas season, the film has proved more popular with audiences than critics, and it has been discussed as being arguably a modern-day Christmas staple.
