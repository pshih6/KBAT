Gottfried Heinrich Gloger (1710–1779) was born in Hannover, Germany, and received his first organ-building training under his father, Johann Heinrich Gloger. Gloger came to Norway as early as 1738, and in 1746 the King awarded him the royal privilege of organ builder. He was the greatest organ builder in Norway during the 18th century – the golden age for the European organ culture.
