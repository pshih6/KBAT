He wrote Lamberto Malatesta (1843), Valenzia Candiano (1843) and Manfredo Pallavicino (1845-1846). He took part in the Italian Risorgimento and was a forerunner of the Milanese Scapigliatura.In 1959 he was part of a consortium of writers who co-edited the newspaper Gazzetta di Milano.
His masterwork is the novel Cento Anni (1859-1864) which, together with Ippolito Nievo's Confessioni di un italiano, had an important impact on the evolution of Italian literature.

Rovani died in Milan in 1874. His body was embalmed by Paolo Gorini and was buried in the Cimitero Monumentale di Milano.
