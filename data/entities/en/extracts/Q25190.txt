Jean Poldo d’Albenas, King's Counsel in Nîmes (France), born in this city in 1512, died in 1563, contributed to the spread of Calvinism in his hometown. He has published in French, among other works, a Discours historial de l’antique et illustre cité de Nismes (1557), that appeared difficult to read to his contemporaries, but full of useful research for historians. He was also a lawyer at the Parliament of Toulouse.
