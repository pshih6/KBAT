Helen Dukas (17 October 1896 â€“ 10 February 1982) was Albert Einstein's secretary. She also co-authored Albert Einstein: Creator and Rebel and co-edited Albert Einstein: The Human Side with Dr. Banesh Hoffmann. Dukas was one of two trustees chosen by Einstein, according to his Last Will and Testament, to hold the literary rights to all of his manuscripts, copyrights, publication rights, royalties, and royalty agreements. The other trustee was the economist Dr. Otto Nathan. In short, Dukas and Dr. Nathan were the "executors of his literary heritage." They collaborated on the compilation of The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, using documents that were subsequently donated to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.Einstein and Dukas were subjected to intrusive surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation under J. Edgar Hoover.
