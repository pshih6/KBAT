Karl-Heinz Gerstner (15 November 1912 â€“ 14 December 2005) trained as a lawyer and then worked during the war for the German diplomatic service in Paris.   Following the war he was released from internment as a Soviet prisoner of war after producing a number of affidavits testifying to his helpfulness to members of the French Resistance during the course of his time at the German embassy in occupied Paris.   He was then able to reinvent himself as an East German journalist.Controversy later emerged, and has persisted, as to the nature and extent of his parallel career as a Stasi informer.
