Baron André Étienne Justin Pascal Joseph François d'Audebert de Férussac (30 December 1786 – 21 January 1836) was a French naturalist best known for his studies of molluscs. (Two of his given names are sometimes spelt Just or Juste instead of Justin, and d'Audibert, d'Audebard, or d'Audeberd instead of "d'Audebert".)
He was born in Chartron, near Lauzerte in the province of Quercy (now in Tarn-et-Garonne), the son of Jean Baptiste Louis d'Audibert de Férussac and Marie Catherine Josèphe de Rozet, and was professor of geography and statistics at the École d'état-major in Paris.
