Dil Chahta Hai (transl.â€‰The Heart Wants) is a 2001 Indian Hindi-language coming-of-age romantic drama film, marking Farhan Akhtar's directorial debut, as well as his debut as a writer. Starring Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Akshaye Khanna, Preity Zinta, Sonali Kulkarni and Dimple Kapadia, the film is set in present-day urban Mumbai and Sydney, and focuses on a major period of transition in the romantic lives of three college-graduate friends.
In 2001, the film won National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. It performed moderately in the urban areas of the country compared to the rural areas, which was attributed by critics to the city-oriented lifestyle depicted in which all the characters are from rich or upper middle class families. Since its release, the film has become a cult classic.
