Metsakalmistu (Estonian: Forest Cemetery) is a cemetery in the Pirita district of Tallinn.
Metsakalmistu was originally planned to be an open city medieval cemetery. Eduard Vilde was the first to be buried in 1933. The original area of the cemetery was 24.2 hectares, but since then, it has expanded to be 48.3 hectares.
Metsakalmistu was officially unveiled in 1939. In the same year, 15 people were buried in the cemetery. In 1939, the nearby Kloostrimetsa Farm cemetery was created, which eventually, through expansion, became part of an expanded Metsakalmistu.
At first, the designers of the cemetery were unanimous about the general design requirements of the cemetery, but the area still dominated by the appearance of a wild forest. Initially, the placement of crosses, girders, ranks, and the largest size of the calcareous stone were 80 x 50 cm. Subsequently, the use of natural barriers, such as grass slabs, has been applied and applied to a moss bed cover and the use of flower borders. The monumental gravestones are not recommended for the cemetery, but they still exist to a small extent. At present, the permissible maximum height for a pillar is 1.5 m.
The main chapel of Metsakalmistu was built in 1936, with its main architect being Herbert Johanson. The chapel was vandalized by the Soviet Union after the establishment of the Estonian SSR, but in 1996 it was restored with the support of the Tallinn City Government. In 2006, a columbarium was built.
Tombstones in Metsakalmistu are reserved for notable Estonian people involved in theatre, sports, composing, writing, the arts, journalism, medicine, architecture, soldiers in Finnish Infantry Regiment 200, veterans of the Estonian War of Independence, scientists and other people well known in public life.
