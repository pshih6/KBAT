Hesham Mohamed Kandil or Kandeel (also spelled:  Hisham Qandil or Qandeel ; Arabic: هشام محمد قنديل‎  pronounced [heˈʃæːm mæˈħæmmæd ʔænˈdiːl]) (born 17 September 1962) is an Egyptian engineer and civil servant who was Prime Minister of Egypt from 2012 to 2013. Qandil was appointed as Prime Minister by President Mohamed Morsi on 24 July 2012. Qandil previously served as Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation from 2011 to 2012.Reuters reported that Qandil was a politically independent senior public servant in the Morsi administration, but was not popularly considered to be a likely candidate for the position of prime minister. Qandil was Egypt's youngest prime minister since Gamal Abdel Nasser's appointment in 1954. When Morsi was ousted in a coup d'état by the military in July 2013, Qandil after initially continuing in his role as prime minister until the formation of a new government, resigned his post on 8 July 2013 in protest of the subsequent bloodshed when 51 protesters were killed by the military at the Republican Guard headquarters. He was arrested on 24 December 2013 and released seven months later on 15 July 2014 after he was acquitted by the Court of Cassation, which accepted his appeal and annulled the one-year sentence against him.
