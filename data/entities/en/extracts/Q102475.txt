GÃ¼nther Stein or Gunther Stein was a German print journalist.
Stein was a foreign correspondent in China for the Manchester Guardian, the Christian Science Monitor, and the Associated Press.
Erwin D. Canham, editor of the Monitor during this period wrote later in his 1958 history of the newspaper, "Commitment to Freedom," of Stein's brief contribution to the paper from Japan and China which ended in 1945.  He refers to reports of Stein as working for the Soviet Union while in Japan and the connection with the Sorge spy ring. He refers to Stein as "enigmatic" and says that "too little was known."
Senator Joseph McCarthy accused Stein of spying for China during the Red Scare, as part of the Sorge spy ring.[1]
Toledano wrote that in 1942 the Institute of Pacific Relations invited Stein to become its Chungking correspondent, from where he wrote books and articles to convey the idea that the Chinese Communists were "a superlative breed of idealists."
