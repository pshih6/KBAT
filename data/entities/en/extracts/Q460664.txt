Prizzi's Honor is a 1985 American black comedy crime-drama film directed by John Huston, adapted by Richard Condon and Janet Roach from Condon's 1982 novel of the same name. Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner star as two Mafia assassins who fall in love, complicating their professions and existing loyalties.
The cast also includes Robert Loggia, William Hickey, and the director's daughter, Anjelica Huston. Alex North's musical score adapts the music of Giacomo Puccini and Gioachino Rossini. It was the last of John Huston's films to be released during his lifetime.
Though studio 20th Century Fox expected the film to be a box office bomb, it proved to be a massive sleeper hit due to critical acclaim and positive word of mouth, becoming one of the best-reviewed films of 1985. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including four of the "Big Five"  (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay), with Anjelica Huston winning for Best Supporting Actress. The film also won four Golden Globes and a BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.
