Henri Lachambre (30 December 1846, Vagney, Vosges  – 12 June 1904) was a French manufacturer of balloons. His factory was in the Paris suburb Vaugirard. He also participated in ballooning himself carried out 500 ascents. 
Lachambre supplied balloons to both the US Signal Corps [1] and the ill-fated arctic mission of S. A. Andrée in 1897. He also worked with the Brazilian aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont, taking him for his first balloon ascent and going on to construct his first balloon in 1898 and later the envelopes for his dirigibles.
