Kate Marie Nash (born 6 July 1987 in London) is an English singer-songwriter and actress, operating in the genres of indie pop and indie rock.
Nash studied at the BRIT School before launching music career in 2005. Her 2007 single "Foundations" became a sleeper hit and brought her to public attention in the UK. Her debut album, Made of Bricks, peaked at number 1 in the UK and was a moderate international success. Nash subsequently won the award for Best British Female Artist at the 2008 Brit Awards. Her second studio album, My Best Friend Is You, was released in 2010 and reached the top 10 in the UK and Germany. After departure from a major label, Nash self-released her third studio album, Girl Talk, in 2013, but it failed to match the commercial success of her previous records. Her fourth and most recent studio album, Yesterday Was Forever, was also released independently in 2018, funded by her fans via a Kickstarter campaign. Aside from music, Nash has acted in various films and TV series. Most notably, she starred in the 2012 film Greetings from Tim Buckley, as well as the 2013 films Powder Room and Syrup. Since 2017, Nash has been part of the cast of the acclaimed Netflix series GLOW as Rhonda "Britannica" Richardson. She is also a feminist activist campaigning to empower girls and women.
