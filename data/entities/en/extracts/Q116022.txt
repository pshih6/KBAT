Jean Le Clerc, also Johannes Clericus (March 19, 1657 in Geneva â€“ January 8, 1736 in Amsterdam), was a Genevan theologian and biblical scholar.  He was famous for promoting exegesis, or critical interpretation of the Bible, and was a radical of his age. He parted with Calvinism over his interpretations and left Geneva for that reason.
