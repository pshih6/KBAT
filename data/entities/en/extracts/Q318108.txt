Mario Armando Lavandeira Jr. (born March 23, 1978), known professionally as Perez Hilton, is an American blogger, columnist, and media personality. His blog, PerezHilton.com (formerly PageSixSixSix.com), is known for posts covering gossip items about celebrities. He is also known for posting tabloid photos over which he has added his own captions or "doodles". His blog has garnered controversy for its attitude, its (former) practice of outing of alleged closeted celebrities, and its role in the increasing coverage of celebrities in all forms of media.
In addition to his blogging, Hilton has written three books, hosts a podcast with Chris Booker, runs two YouTube channels, and has acted in two off-Broadway shows. In 2018, he was dubbed "the original celebrity social media influencer" by BroadwayWorld.
