NTNU is consistently ranked in the top one percentage among the world's universities, usually in the 101–500 range depending on ranking.NTNU has the main national responsibility for education and research in engineering and technology, and is the successor of Norway's preeminent engineering university, the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH), established by Parliament in 1910 as Norway's national engineering university. In addition to engineering and natural sciences, the university offers higher education in other academic disciplines ranging from medicine, psychology, social sciences, the arts, teacher education, architecture and fine art. NTNU is well known for its close collaboration with industry, and particularly with its R&D partner SINTEF, which provided it with the biggest industrial link among all the technical universities in the world. The university's academics include three Nobel laureates in medicine, Edvard Moser, May-Britt Moser and John O'Keefe.
