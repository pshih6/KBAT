Futbol Club Barcelona B is a Spanish football team based in Barcelona, in the autonomous community of Catalonia.
Founded in 1970 as FC Barcelona Atlètic, it is the reserve team of FC Barcelona, and currently plays in Segunda División B, holding home matches at the Estadi Johan Cruyff.
Reserve teams in Spain play in the same league system as the senior team, rather than in a reserve team league. They must play at least one level below their main side, and thus Barcelona B are ineligible for promotion to La Liga. They also cannot play in the Copa del Rey.
