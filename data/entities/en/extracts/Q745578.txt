Pier Vittorio Tondelli (September 14, 1955 â€“ December 16, 1991) was an Italian writer who wrote a small but influential body of work.  He was born in Correggio, a small town in the  Emilia-Romagna region in Italy and died in nearby Reggio Emilia because of AIDS.  Tondelli enjoyed modest success as a writer but often encountered trouble with censors for his use of homosexual themes in his works. Tondelli was buried in a small cemetery in the hamlet of Canolo, just outside Correggio.
