Goal III: Taking on the World (also known as Goal III) is a 2009 sports drama film, the third part of the Goal! film trilogy. It was directed by Andrew Morahan, and written and produced by Mike Jefferies, who returned from the first two Goal! films. Unlike its two predecessors, this film did not have a theatrical release and was instead released straight to DVD and Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on 15 June 2009.
Many of the key filmmakers who made the first two films did not participate, including the original screenwriters and most central cast members. Kuno Becker, who played protagonist Santiago Mu√±ez in the first two films, appears only briefly at the start. The film instead focuses on two fictional England players at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, Charlie Braithwaite (Leo Gregory) and Liam Adams (JJ Feild).
