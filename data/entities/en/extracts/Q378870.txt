Daniele Matteo Alvise Barbaro (also Barbarus) (8 February 1514 â€“ 13 April 1570) was an Italian architect, writer on architecture, and translator of, and commentator on, Vitruvius. He also had a significant ecclesiastical career.
Barbaro's fame is chiefly due to his vast output in the arts, letters, and mathematics. A cultured humanist, he was a friend and admirer of Torquato Tasso, a patron of Andrea Palladio, and a student of Pietro Bembo. Francesco Sansovino considered Daniele to be one of the three best Venetian architects, along with Palladio and Francesco's father Jacopo.
