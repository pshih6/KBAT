Al-Hallaj (Arabic: ابو المغيث الحسين بن منصور الحلاج‎ Abū 'l-Muġīth Al-Ḥusayn bin Manṣūr al-Ḥallāj) or Mansour Hallaj (Persian: منصور حلاج‎ Mansūr-e Hallāj) (c. 858 – 26 March  922) (Hijri c. 244 AH – 309 AH) was a Persian mystic, poet and teacher of Sufism. He is best known for his saying: "I am the Truth" (Ana 'l-Ḥaqq), which many saw as a claim to divinity, while others interpreted it as an instance of annihilation of the ego which allows God to speak through the individual. Al-Hallaj gained a wide following as a preacher before he became implicated in power struggles of the Abbasid court and was executed after a long period of confinement on religious and political charges. Although most of his Sufi contemporaries disapproved of his actions, Hallaj later became a major figure in the Sufi tradition.
