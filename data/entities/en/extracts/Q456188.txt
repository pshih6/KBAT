Muhammad Shahrour (Arabic: محمد شحرور‎, 11 April 1938 – 21 December 2019) was a Syrian thinker and author. He was an Emeritus Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Damascus who wrote extensively about Islam. Shahrour was trained as an engineer in Syria, the former Soviet Union and Ireland.
He referred to the book of Prophet Mohammad as "The Book", not the Quran; which casts him in direct contradiction with all other Islamic thinkers and traditional scholars. Yet similar to Quraniyoon Muslims, he did not consider Hadith as a divine source; however, he did not belong to the same school as Ahmed Subhy Mansour.
