Giovanni Lombardo Radice (born 23 September 1954, Rome, Italy) is an Italian film actor, better known to audiences as John Morghen.
Radice is best known for his villainous roles in Italian horror films, and notably for the spectacular and gruesome death scenes his characters semi-regularly fall victim to.  In several interviewe, he reportedly stated that he wished he had never portrayed Mike Logan in Cannibal Ferox, criticizing the movie for being both fascist and racist and abusive towards animals. Radice created his stage name, John Morghen, by taking the anglicized form of his first name (Giovanni becomes John) and using his grandmother's maiden name as his last name (Morghen). His family practically disowned him when they discovered he was using his family name to create incredibly violent films.Radice's uncle is Pietro Ingrao, the first member of the Italian Communist Party to be Head of Parliament in the 1970s. Radice nowadays often posts texts criticizing social injustice, capitalism and corruption in Italy.
Radice has written about having a cocaine addiction when younger.
