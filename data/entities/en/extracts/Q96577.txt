Johann Balthasar Schupp (1 March 1610 â€“ 26 October 1661) was a German satirical author and a writer of Christian lyrics. After 1654, his having switched mid-career to a position as a high-profile Lutheran pastor, the content and populist approach of Schupp's sermons and of the printed pamphlets which he now started to publish brought him into increasingly acrimonious conflict with Hamburg's (relatively) conservative church establishment.Much of his later written work appeared under a succession of pseudonyms.  These included Antenor, Philandron, Ehrnhold, Philanderson, Mellilambius and Ambrosius.
