Suretone Records is an American record label established in 2006 as a joint venture by Jordan Schur, former CEO of Geffen Records, and Interscope Records, to release alternative rock music. Several high-profile bands such as Weezer, The Cure, Rooney, New Found Glory and Angels and Airwaves, the new band put together by Tom DeLonge (blink-182) will remain on Geffen and will carry the Suretone imprint. The Pink Spiders (which will be released through Geffen), Headway, Eastern Conference Champions and all newly signed acts, such as Shwayze, will be on Suretone Records and released by Interscope.
The label shut down in 2010 after the failures of albums by Chris Cornell and Shwayze. In 2016, the Suretone label returned with distribution through the Alternative Distribution Alliance.
