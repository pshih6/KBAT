Jörg Fauser (16 July 1944 in Bad Schwalbach – 17 July 1987 in Munich) was a German writer, poet and journalist.
The influence of the American beat generation literature on his works is well known. Together with Carl Weissner and other colleagues he published several issues of the literature magazine Gasolin 23 which included work by William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg and the first German translations of short stories by Charles Bukowski. His later works are mostly German detective stories. "Der Schneemann" has been made into a movie. He died when a truck hit him while walking on a motorway near Munich. Fauser's autobiographical novel, Rohstoff, a cutting look at the German counter-culture scene of the late 1960s and early 1970s, has been translated into English by Jamie Bulloch as Raw Material and published by Clerkenwell Press.
