Kyoto Jazz Massive is a Japanese musical project specialising in crossover jazz and electronic styles, consisting of the two brothers Shuya and Yoshihiro Okino. The group has also included Hajime Yoshizawa, the pianist producer, on a number of works and albums.  Although the brothers DJed in the late 1980s and were remixing and composing as far back as the early 1990s, they were largely popularised by the British Radio 1 DJ Gilles Peterson in around 2001. The band is signed to Compost Records.
The group has held a number of events and shows in and around Japan, and have worked with countless artists through remixing tunes or production of their own tracks, and have worked with several labels.  They include (but are not limited to) Bebel Gilberto, Monday Michiru, DJ Krush, Especial Records, Far Out Records, Yellow Productions.
