Baseball Bugs is a 1946 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes theatrical animated cartoon starring Bugs Bunny which was originally released on February 2, 1946. In the short, Bugs Bunny singlehandedly defeats the "Gas-House Gorillas", a baseball team of hulking, cigar-chomping bullies. The cartoon has been called Bugs "at his best" and is still referenced by baseball fans and observers.
