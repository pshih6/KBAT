He was the publisher of the Jewish weekly magazine Die Neue Welt, established in 1926 as a replacement for the defunct Zionist journal Die Welt.After the Anschluss, Robert Stricker was sent to Dachau, but was eventually released. In 1942 he was sent to Theresienstadt, and is reported to have been killed in 1944 in Auschwitz.
