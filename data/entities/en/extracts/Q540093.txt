Antonio de Torres Jurado (b. 13 June 1817 in Almería, Andalucía – d. 19 November 1892) was a Spanish guitarist and luthier, and "the most important Spanish guitar maker of the 19th century."It is with his designs that the first recognisably modern classical guitars are to be seen. Most acoustic guitars in use today are derivatives of his designs.
