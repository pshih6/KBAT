Anthony Astley Cooper Rogers (February 14, 1821 â€“ July 27, 1899) was an American politician. He served in the House of Representative from Arkansas.
Born in Clarksville, Tennessee, Rogers received a limited schooling.  He engaged in mercantile pursuits.
He moved to Arkansas in 1854.  An opponent of Secession, he was a candidate of supporters of the Union as a delegate to the State convention in 1861.  He was arrested for his loyalty, imprisoned, and forced to give bond to answer the charge of "treason against the Confederate Government."
Rogers was elected to the 38th United States Congress, but was not allowed to take his seat, his State not having been readmitted.  In 1864, he moved to Chicago, Illinois, and engaged in the real estate business.  He returned to Arkansas in 1868.
Rogers was elected as a Democrat to the 41st Congress, March 4, 1869, to March 3, 1871.  He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1870 to the 42nd Congress.  He was postmaster at Pine Bluff, Arkansas, from January 7, 1881, to July 24, 1885, and again engaged in mercantile pursuits.
In 1888, he moved to Los Angeles, where he died the following year at the age of 78. He is interred in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery.
