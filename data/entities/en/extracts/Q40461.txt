Bachata is a genre of Latin America music that originated in the Dominican Republic in the first half of the 20th century with primarily African rhythms and also remnants of Indigenous and European musical elements, much representative of the cultural diversity of the Dominican Republic population .The first recorded compositions of Bachata were done by José Manuel Calderón from the Dominican Republic. Bachata originates from Bolero and Son (and later, from the mid 1980s, Merengue).  The original term used to name the genre was amargue ("bitterness", "bitter music", or "blues music"), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term bachata became popular. The form of dance, bachata, also developed with the music.
