Wolfgang Schwanitz (born 26 June 1930) is a former East German communist official, who was the last head of the Stasi, the East German secret police. It was officially renamed the "Office for National Security" on 17 November 1989. Unlike his predecessor, Erich Mielke, he did not hold the title "Minister of State Security", but held the title of "Leader of the Office for National Security". Since the German reunification, he has been active as an author of works that seek to portray the Stasi in a positive light.
