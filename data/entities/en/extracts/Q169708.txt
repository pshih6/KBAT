Luigi Firpo (4 January 1915 in Turin â€“ 2 March 1989 in Turin) was an Italian historian and politician.
He taught history of political thought at the University of Turin. He has been credited as "an excellent editor and lucky finder of texts" which were particularly influential in the study of Tommaso Campanella. In 1943, a time of great upheaval for Italy, Firpo discovered in Trento's Civic Library a 1602 manuscript of Campanella's The City of the Sun (shelf mark BCT1-1538), which is considered the most ancient manuscript copy that has survived to present time.
Firpo was a member of the Italian Republican Party and of the Italian Parliament serving from 9 July 1987 to March 2, 1989.
