(T)Raumschiff Surprise - Periode 1 is a German movie made in 2004 by Michael Herbig. As a spiritual successor to Der Schuh des Manitu, (T)Raumschiff Surprise - Periode 1 is based on a recurring skit from Herbig's TV show Bullyparade, "Unser (T)Raumschiff", a spoof of the 1960s American television series, Star Trek. The title and plot allude to Raumschiff Enterprise, the German title of Star Trek. Raumschiff is the German word for spacecraft; Traumschiff means "dream ship", which was also a reference to Das Traumschiff, a German television series, similar to the series The Love Boat. The movie parodies several science fiction films.
