Hans Schneeberger (7 April 1895 â€“ 19 November 1971) was an Austrian cinematographer who worked on over eighty films during his career. During the 1920s and early 1930s Schneeberger worked frequently with the director Arnold Fanck, including films starring Leni Riefenstahl. 
Schneeberger also made a handful of acting appearances, including playing opposite Riefenstahl in The Great Leap (1927). He filmed the famous final shot in The Third Man but was not credited. Schneeberger was later employed by the largest Austrian company Wien-Film for a number of productions.
