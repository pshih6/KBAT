Irkutsk ( eer-KOOTSK; Russian: Иркутск, IPA: [ɪrˈkutsk]; Buryat and Mongolian: Эрхүү, Erhüü) is the administrative center of Irkutsk Oblast, Russia, and one of the largest cities in Siberia.
Many distinguished Russians were sent into exile in Irkutsk for their part in the Decembrist revolt of 1825, and the city became an exile-post for the rest of the century. Some fine, historic wooden houses still survive. When the railway reached Irkutsk, it had earned the nickname of "The Paris of Siberia." 
The city was the center of bitter fighting in the Russian Civil War of 1918–20. Afterward, in the Soviet period, its architecture was dominated by blocky Soviet style. The city became a major centre of aircraft manufacture.
The Trans-Siberian Highway (Federal M53 and M55 Highways) and Trans-Siberian Railway connect Irkutsk to other regions in Russia and Mongolia.
