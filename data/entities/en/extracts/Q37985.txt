Carinthia (German: Kärnten, German pronunciation: [ˈkɛʁntn̩] (listen); Slovene: Koroška, pronunciation ; Italian: Carinzia) is the southernmost Austrian state or Land. Situated within the Eastern Alps, it is noted for its mountains and lakes. The main language is German. Its regional dialects belong to the Southern Bavarian group. Carinthian Slovene dialects, forms of a South Slavic language that predominated in the southeastern part of the region up to the first half of the 20th century, are now spoken by a small minority in the area.
Carinthia's main industries are tourism, electronics, engineering, forestry, and agriculture. The multinational corporations Philips, Infineon Technologies and Siemens have large operations there.
