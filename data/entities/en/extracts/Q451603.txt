On Golden Pond is a 1981 American drama film directed by Mark Rydell. The screenplay by Ernest Thompson was adapted from his 1979 play of the same name. The film stars Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda (in his final acting performance) in the lead roles along with Jane Fonda, Doug McKeon, Dabney Coleman and William Lanteau appearing in supporting roles. The film's narrative revolves around an aged couple, cantankerous retiree Norman Thayer and his conciliatory wife Ethel, who spend summers at their New England vacation home on the shores of idyllic Golden Pond. This year, their adult daughter, Chelsea, visits with her new fianc√© and his teenage son, Billy, on their way to Europe. After leaving Billy behind to bond with Norman, Chelsea returns, attempting to repair the long-strained relationship with her aging father before it's too late.
On Golden Pond was released theatrically on December 4, 1981 and grossed $119.3 million domestically, becoming the second highest-grossing film of 1981. The film received critical acclaim for Rydell's direction, Thompson's screenplay and Hepburn and Fonda's performances.
The film received ten nominations at the 54th Academy Awards including Best Picture and won three: Best Actor (Henry Fonda), Best Actress (Hepburn) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Thompson). Henry Fonda won his only competitive Oscar with this film and at the age of 76 became the oldest winner in the Best Actor category, while Katharine Hepburn won her fourth Best Actress award, extending her own record for the most Oscars won by a thespian. 
On Golden Pond is also one of the few movies to earn the nominations for the Big Five Academy Awards (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay).
