David Friedrich Strauss (German: Strauß [ʃtʀaʊs]; January 27, 1808 in Ludwigsburg – February 8, 1874 ibid) was a German liberal Protestant theologian and writer, who influenced Christian Europe with his portrayal of the "historical Jesus", whose divine nature he denied.  His work was connected to the Tübingen School, which revolutionized study of the New Testament, early Christianity, and ancient religions.  Strauss was a pioneer in the historical investigation of Jesus.
