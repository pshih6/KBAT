Georg Waitz (9 October 1813 â€“ 24 May 1886) was a German historian and politician. Waitz is often spoken of as the chief disciple of Leopold von Ranke, though perhaps in general characteristics and mental attitude he has more affinity with Georg Heinrich Pertz or Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann. His special domain was medieval German history, and he rarely travelled beyond it.
