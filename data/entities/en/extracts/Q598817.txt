Hollywood Burbank Airport, legally and formerly marketed as Bob Hope Airport (IATA: BUR, ICAO: KBUR, FAA LID: BUR), is a public airport 3 miles (4.8 km) northwest of downtown Burbank, in Los Angeles County, California, United States. The airport serves Downtown Los Angeles and the northern Greater Los Angeles area, including Glendale, Pasadena, and the San Fernando Valley. It is closer to Griffith Park, Hollywood, and Downtown Los Angeles than Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and is the only airport in the area with a direct rail connection to downtown Los Angeles. Non-stop flights mostly serve cities in the western United States, while JetBlue Airways has daily flights to New York City and Boston and Delta Airlines has daily flights to Atlanta.
Originally the entire airport was within the Burbank city limits, but the north end of Runway 15/33 has been extended into the city of Los Angeles. The airport is owned by the Burbank–Glendale–Pasadena Airport Authority and controlled by the governments of those cities. The Airport Authority contracts with TBI Airport Management, Inc., to operate the airport, which has its own police and fire departments, the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority Police. Boarding uses portable boarding steps or ramps rather than jet bridges. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021 categorized it as a medium-hub primary commercial service facility.Hollywood Burbank Airport has a strict noise abatement procedure to reduce noise of aircraft arriving and departing from the airport. Commercial flights will not be scheduled between the hours of 10:00pm and 7:00am, all departing flights will take off to the south on Runway 15, and all arriving flights will land on runway 8; however, departing flights are prohibited from using runway 8.
