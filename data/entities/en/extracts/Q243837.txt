Ottorino Respighi ( reh-SPEE-ghee, also US:  rə-, Italian: [ottoˈriːno reˈspiːɡi]; 9 July 1879 – 18 April 1936) was an Italian violinist, composer, and musicologist who became one of the leading Italian composers in the early 20th century. Among Respighi's best known works are his three symphonic poems, Fountains of Rome (1916), Pines of Rome (1924), and Roman Festivals (1928), which displayed rich orchestral colours and brought him international fame. His musicological interest in 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century music led him to compose pieces based on the music of these periods.
