Oskar Maria Graf (22 July 1894 â€“ 28 June 1967) was a German author.
He wrote several narratives about life in Bavaria, mostly autobiographical.
In the beginning Graf wrote under his real name Oskar Graf. After 1918, his works for newspapers were signed with the pseudonym Oskar Graf-Berg; for works he regarded as "worth reading", he used the name Oskar Maria Graf.
