Therese Huber (7 May 1764 – 15 June 1829) was a German author. She was one of the so-called Universitätsmamsellen, a group of five academically active women during the mid-18th and early 19th centuries. The group consisted of daughters of academics at Göttingen University; Huber was noteworthy among them, alongside Meta Forkel-Liebeskind, Caroline Schelling, Philippine Engelhard, and Dorothea Schlözer.
