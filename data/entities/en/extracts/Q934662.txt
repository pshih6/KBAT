Sotigui Kouyaté (19 July 1936 – 17 April 2010) was one of the first Burkinabé actors. He was the father of film director Dani Kouyaté
and was a member of the Mandinka ethnic group.Members of Kouyaté's lineage or clan have served as griots for the Keita dynasty since at least the 13th century. The Kouyatés guard customs, and their knowledge is authoritative among Mandinkas. Keitas have to provide amenities to Kouyatés, who in turn should not hesitate to ask for Keita help. The word Kouyaté translates as "there is a secret between you and me".
