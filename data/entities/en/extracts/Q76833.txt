Carl Zeiss (German pronunciation: [ˈkaɐ̯l ˈtsaɪ̯s]; 11 September 1816 – 3 December 1888) was a German scientific instrument maker, optician and businessman who founded the workshop of Carl Zeiss in 1846, which is still in business today as Carl Zeiss AG.  Zeiss gathered a group of gifted practical and theoretical opticians and glass makers to reshape most aspects of optical instrument production.  His collaboration with Ernst Abbe revolutionized optical theory and practical design of microscopes.  Their quest to extend these advances brought Otto Schott into the enterprises to revolutionize optical glass manufacture.  The firm of Carl Zeiss grew to one of the largest and most respected optical firms in the world.
