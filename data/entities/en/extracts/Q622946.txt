Aqua Teen Hunger Force (also known by various alternative titles) is an American adult animated television series created by Dave Willis and Matt Maiellaro for Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim. It is about the surreal adventures and antics of three anthropomorphic fast food items: Master Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad, who live together as relatives and frequently interact with their human next-door neighbor, Carl Brutananadilewski.
It was created as a spin-off series of Space Ghost Coast to Coast. The unannounced pilot episode, "Rabbot", aired on Cartoon Network on December 30, 2000; the series later made its official debut on Adult Swim on September 9, 2001. Every episode was written and directed by Willis and Maiellaro, who also provided several voices. Seasons 8â€“11 were each given a different alternative title, accompanied by a different theme music, as a running joke. The series ended on August 30, 2015, with a total of 139 episodes over the course of 11 seasons.
Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters, a film adaptation of the series, was released in theaters on April 13, 2007, the first adaptation of an Adult Swim series into a feature-length film. The series airs in broadcast syndication outside the United States and has been released on various DVD sets and other forms of home media, including video on demand streaming. It was the longest-running Adult Swim series until it was surpassed by The Venture Bros. (in terms of years), Squidbillies (in terms of seasons), and Robot Chicken (in terms of episodes).
