Bernard Joseph Cribbins, OBE (born 29 December 1928) is an English character actor, comedy actor, voice-over artist and musical comedian with a career spanning over seventy years. He has been in work consistently since his professional debut in the mid-1950s.
In Britain, during the early 1960s, Cribbins became known for his successful novelty records, especially "Right Said Fred" and appeared as Albert Perks in The Railway Children (1970). He narrated The Wombles, a BBC children's television programme that ran for 60 episodes between 1973 and 1975, and played the pretentious guest Mr. Hutchinson in "The Hotel Inspectors" episode of Fawlty Towers (1975), and the belligerent barman in Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy (1972). He was a regular and prolific reader for the BBC's Jackanory from 1966 to 1991.
Having appeared as Tom Campbell, a companion to Dr. Who in the feature film Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D. (1966), Cribbins appeared in Doctor Who four decades later as Wilfred Mott, the grandfather of Donna Noble, the companion to television's Tenth Doctor.
