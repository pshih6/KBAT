The Christian Democratic Appeal (Dutch: Christen-Democratisch Appèl, pronounced [krɪstə(n)deːmoːkraːtis ɑˈpɛl]; CDA) is a Christian-democratic political party in the Netherlands. The CDA was originally formed in 1977 from a confederation of the Catholic People's Party, the Anti-Revolutionary Party and the Christian Historical Union, and has participated in all but three governments since then. Sybrand van Haersma Buma has been the Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal since 18 May 2012.
The party suffered severe losses in the 2010 general election, losing half of its seats and falling to fourth place in the House of Representatives. From 2010 to 2012 consequently, the CDA was a junior coalition partner in a right-wing minority First Rutte cabinet with the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), supported in the States General by the Party for Freedom (PVV). Subsequently, the CDA again lost a considerable number of seats in the 2012 general election, dropping to fifth place. During the 2017 general election, the party won 19 seats (third place) and is part of the current centre-right Third Rutte cabinet with the VVD, D66 and CU.
