Bjørn Eidsvåg (born 17 March 1954) is a Norwegian singer, songwriter and ordained minister in the Lutheran Church of Norway. He was born in Sauda, and is a graduate (cand. theol.) of the MF Norwegian School of Theology. He has released more than 25 albums since his 1976 debut, and received the Norwegian music award the Spellemannsprisen at least three times.
His list of songs is very long. He is probably best known for his melancholic 1983 song "Eg ser" (I see).
