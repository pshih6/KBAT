Henry Algernon du Pont (July 30, 1838 â€“ December 31, 1926) was an American military officer, businessman, and politician from Delaware. A member of the famed Du Pont family, he graduated first in his class from West Point shortly after the beginning of the American Civil War and served in the U.S. Army, earning the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Cedar Creek in October 1864.
After retiring from the Army in 1875, he was president of the Wilmington and Northern Railroad Company for 20 years, until 1899.  An active member of the Republican Party, he was elected by the state legislature as a U.S. Senator from Delaware, serving most of two terms (June 13, 1906 to March 4, 1917).
