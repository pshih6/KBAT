Vietnamese people, or Viet People (Vietnamese: người Việt), are people whose nationality is Vietnamese. There are 54 ethnic groups in Vietnam, each with its own language, lifestyle, and cultural heritage. The majority of Vietnamese are Kinh people (người Kinh) who are an East Asian ethnic group native to present-day northern Vietnam and southern China. They speak Vietnamese, the most widely spoken Austroasiatic language. They formed 85% of the population of Vietnam in the 2019 census, and are officially known as Kinh to distinguish them from minority ethnic groups within the country. The earliest recorded name for the ancient Vietnamese people is Lạc or Lạc Việt.
Although Vietnam is geographically and linguistically considered Southeast Asian, the Vietnamese belong in the East Asian cultural sphere due to the historical Chinese domination of Vietnam. They are culturally very similar to neighboring southern Han Chinese subgroups and other ethnic minorities from South China. The word Việt derives from Bách Việt ('Baiyue' in Chinese) and Nam means "south". "Baiyue" was a name used by the Han Chinese in ancient times to describe various southern non-Chinese peoples. Together, Vietnam means "to the south of the Viet", as Vietnam is located south of the Bách Việt.
The Viet are one of the 4 main groups of Vietic speakers in Vietnam, the others being the Muong, Thổ and Chứt.
