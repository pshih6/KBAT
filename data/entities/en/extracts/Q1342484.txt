The Robert College of Istanbul (Turkish: İstanbul Özel Amerikan Robert Lisesi or Robert Kolej, often abbreviated to RC) is an independent high school in Turkey. The co-educational boarding school is situated in a 65-acre (26 ha) wooded campus on the European side of Istanbul in the Beşiktaş district, with the historic Arnavutköy neighborhood to the east, and the upscale Ulus neighborhood to the west.
