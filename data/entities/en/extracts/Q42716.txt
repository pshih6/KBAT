Saint-Étienne (French: [sɛ̃t‿etjɛn]; Arpitan: Sant-Etiève; English: Saint Stephen) is a city in eastern central France, in the Massif Central, 55 km (34 mi) southwest of Lyon in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, on the trunk road that connects Toulouse with Lyon. Saint-Étienne is the capital of the Loire department and has a population of approximately 172,023 (2013) in the city itself and over 508,000 in the metropolitan area (2011).
In the last years Saint-Étienne made important transformations for transitioning from a 19th-century industrial city to the 21st century "European capital of design". This approach led to important urban renovations of the main districts of the city.
