"Living the other one that I am that wasn't what would have been.Living what would have been dying which I am still not.
Sleeping all was I, another waking I go."
Nos habremos deseado tanto / que el beso habrá muerto. Desnudo día, 1936 We will have wanted each other so bad / that the kiss will have died. Naked day, 1936
