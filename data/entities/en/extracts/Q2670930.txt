Roma chairman Franco Sensi with the goal to bring the Sicilian team back to Serie A, a goal that was achieved with promotion in the 2003–04 season.
In April 2012 he was suspended one year for involvement in third-party ownership; however, this was shortened to 5 months after appeal.On 27 February 2017, Zamparini stepped down as chairman of Palermo after 15 years in charge with over 40 managerial changes (the last one being the appointment of Diego López as head coach in place of resigning Eugenio Corini a month previous), announcing he had formally sold his controlling stake to an unspecified Anglo-American fund. On 4 July 2017, Paul Baccaglini resigned as Palermo chairmen, falling back into the hands of Zamparini, after the necessary funds were not in place. Zamparini had declared that he would not seek the place of chairman after Baccaglini's resignation.
