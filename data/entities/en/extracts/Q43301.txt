Fresno ( FREZ-noh; Spanish: [ˈfɾezno] for "ash tree") is a city in and the county seat of Fresno County, California, United States. It covers about 112 square miles (290 km2) in the center of the San Joaquin Valley, the southern portion of California's Central Valley.
Named for the abundant ash trees lining the San Joaquin River, Fresno was founded in 1872 as a railway station of the Central Pacific Railroad before it was incorporated in 1885. The city has since become an economic hub of Fresno County and the San Joaquin Valley, with much of the surrounding areas in the Metropolitan Fresno region predominantly tied to large-scale agricultural production.
The population of Fresno grew from 134,000 in 1960 to 428,000 in 2000. With a census-estimated 2018 population of 530,093, Fresno is the fifth-most populous city in California, the most populous inland city in California, and the 34th-most populous city in the nation.
