The Moderates or Moderate Republicans (French: Républicains modérés), pejoratively labeled Opportunist Republicans (French: Républicains opportunistes), were a French political group active in the late 19th century during the Third French Republic. The leaders of the group included Adolphe Thiers, Jules Ferry, Jules Grévy, Henri Wallon and René Waldeck-Rousseau.
Although they were considered leftist at the time, the Opportunists progressively evolved into a centre-right, law and order and vaguely anti-labour political party. During their existence, the Moderate Republicans were present in the French Parliament first under the name of Republican Left (French: Gauche républicaine) and after a fusion with radical republicans as the Democratic Union (French: Union démocratique).
They were further divided into the National Republican Association (French: Association nationale républicaine) and the Liberal Republican Union (French: Union libérale républicaine) in 1888 and 1889, respectively.
