Oliver Twist is a 1933 American pre-Code film directed by William J. Cowen. It is the earliest sound version of Charles Dickens's novel of the same name. It stars Dickie Moore as Oliver, Irving Pichel as Fagin, Doris Lloyd as Nancy, and William "Stage" Boyd as Bill Sikes. Pichel played Fagin without resorting to any mannerisms which could be construed as offensive.Released by Monogram Pictures, the film was made on an extremely low budget. It never really achieved much success and was out of circulation for many years, but resurfaced on television in the 1980s.
