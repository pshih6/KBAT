Attila Ambrus (born October 6, 1967), alias The Whiskey Robber is a Hungarian bank robber and professional ice hockey player. He became notorious during the 1990s for committing a string of undercover "gentleman robberies" in and around Budapest, Hungary, while working a day job as a goaltender. He became infamous in Hungary as a folk hero symbolic of the times in the decade after the introduction of capitalism to the former Communist state. Ambrus was eventually caught and imprisoned for about 12 years, released in 2012. His story was made into a book, Ballad of the Whiskey Robber (2004), by author Julian Rubinstein, which has been optioned by Johnny Depp for a possible film adaptation.
