Niels Ryberg Finsen (15 December 1860 â€“ 24 September 1904) was a Faroese physician and scientist, the first and currently only Nobel laureate from the country. 
In 1903, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology "in recognition of his contribution to the treatment of diseases, especially lupus vulgaris, with concentrated light radiation, whereby he has opened a new avenue for medical science." 
As a result of this, the Faroe Islands technically have the most Nobel laureates per capita.
