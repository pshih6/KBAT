Alberto Magno Rivera Romero (September 19, 1935 â€“ June 20, 1997) was an anti-Catholic religious activist who was the source of many of the conspiracy theories about the Vatican espoused by fundamentalist Christian author Jack Chick.
Chick promised to promote Rivera's testimony even after he died. Rivera had allegedly been a Jesuit before becoming a Fundamentalist Protestant, and many of the stories Chick published about Rivera involve Jesuit activities.
