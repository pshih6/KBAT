Société Airlinair, simply known as Airlinair, was a French regional airline based in Rungis, France, operating scheduled regional flights (some of which were on behalf of Air France), and aircraft lease services. The airline has set up bases at Paris-Orly Airport and Lyon-Saint Exupéry Airport. As an Air France regional partner, it also offered flights from Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport
Airlinair, along with Régional and Airlinair, was fully merged in HOP! since 2017 after a year of negotiation process.
