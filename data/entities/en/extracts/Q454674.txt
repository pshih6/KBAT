Amar Akbar Anthony is a 1977 Indian action comedy film, directed and produced by Manmohan Desai, and written by Kader Khan. The film stars Vinod Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor opposite Shabana Azmi, Parveen Babi and Neetu Singh in the lead roles. The plot focuses on three brothers who are separated in childhood and adopted by three families of different faiths—Hinduism, Islam and Christianity. They grow up to be a policeman, a singer, and an owner of a country liquor bar, respectively.
The soundtrack album was composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal and the lyrics were written by Anand Bakshi. The film had been released on 27 May 1977, in which it earned ₹ 155 million in India, and became the highest-grossing Indian film of that year, alongside Dharam Veer and Hum Kisise Kum Naheen.
The film about religious tolerance became a landmark for Bollywood masala films, building on the masala formula pioneered several years earlier with Nasir Hussain's Yaadon Ki Baarat (1973). Amar Akbar Anthony also had a lasting impact on pop culture, with its catchy songs, one-liners and the character of Anthony Gonsalves played by Amitabh Bachchan. It won several awards at 25th Filmfare Awards including Best Actor, Best Music Director and Best Editing. It was later remade in Tamil as Shankar Salim Simon (1978), in Telugu as Ram Robert Rahim (1980) and in Malayalam as John Jaffer Janardhanan (1982).
