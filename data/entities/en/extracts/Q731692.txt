Robert Bruce Simonds Jr. (born 1964) is an American film producer, entrepreneur and the founder, chairman and CEO of STX Entertainment, which creates, produces, distributes, finances and markets film (as STXfilms), television (as STXtelevision), digital media (as STXdigital), and live events and virtual reality (as STXsurreal). The company bridges the gap between China and the US, with additional partnerships around the globe (as STXinternational). According to The Wall Street Journal, in its first four years, Simonds more than tripled the company's valuation to an estimated US$3.5 billion. In September 2017, it was reported that STX was close to an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK), and in April 2018, the company announced it had filed for an IPO. In October 2018, it was announced that STX would not go through with the IPO, as market conditions had changed. Prior to STX, Simonds was an independent film producer whose over 30 films have generated more than $6 billion in worldwide box office revenue.
