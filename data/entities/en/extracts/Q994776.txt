Brutalist architecture, or Brutalism, is a style of modernist architecture which emerged in the mid-20th century and gained popularity in the late 1950s. It is characterized by bold, minimalist constructions that showcase the bare building materials and structural elements of the design. The term was derived from the French phrase béton-brut ("raw concrete"), and typically favors elements such as exposed concrete slabs, geometric structures, massive forbidding walls, double-height ceilings, and a predominantly monochrome color palette. Brutalist designs privilege stripped-down structures and function over decorative elements.

Brutalism descended from the modernist movement of the late 19th century and early 20th century. It emerged during the reconstruction projects of the post-war era, as Great Britain and countries in the Soviet Bloc began producing utilitarian, low-cost social housing influenced by modernist and socialist principles. The style was profoundly influenced by the work of French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier, and developed by architects such as Britain's Alison and Peter Smithson and Hungarian-born Ernő Goldfinger. Brutalism soon spread to other regions across the world, including Asia and the North America. It became been most commonly used in the design of institutional buildings, such as libraries, courts, public housing and city halls. The popularity of the movement began to decline in the late 1970s, with some associating the style with urban decay and totalitarianism.Brutalism's stark, geometric designs have historically been polarising; specific buildings, as well as the movement as a whole, have drawn a range of criticism (often being described as "cold" or "soulless") as well as support from architects and local communities (with many brutalist buildings having become cultural icons, sometimes buildings obtaining listed status). In recent decades, the movement has become a subject of renewed interest.
