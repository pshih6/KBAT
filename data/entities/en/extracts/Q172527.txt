Paul England (28 March 1929 â€“ 17 June 2014) was an Australian former racing driver. He worked for the Repco company and raced his own 138 Holden-powered grey motor Ausca sports racing car that used a fiberglass body based on the A6GCS Maserati. The AUSCA also won the Tom Sulman Trophy at Amaroo Park in 1980 by new owner and driver Bruce Polain having restored the car with the assistance of Dave Mawer.
England contested a single Formula One World Championship Grand Prix race, the 1957 German Grand Prix, in a Formula Two Cooper T41-Climax. He retired from the race due to a fault with the distributor. After his return from Europe, England used a car by the same name Ausca but was a totally different creation - an 1800cc VW in front and a 2200cc VW in back both supercharged by the one supercharger with a special manifold to take the compressed intake to the other end, to win three Australian Hillclimb Championships, in 1970, 1973 and 1974.
After retiring from racing, England owned a general engineering company called Paul England & Staff in Essendon, Victoria, Australia. Paul England & Staff is run by his first child and eldest daughter, Lisa Mary Coulton and her husband Steven Coulton. Paul had nine grandchildren.
In the 1970s England's company built 1.6 litre Ford engines for motor racing which were referred to as an England engine.
