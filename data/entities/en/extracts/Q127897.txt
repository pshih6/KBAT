Jersey Girl is a 2004 American comedy-drama film written, co-edited and directed by Kevin Smith. It stars Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, George Carlin, Stephen Root, Mike Starr and Raquel Castro. The film follows a young man who must take care of his precocious daughter in the midst of a family tragedy.
It was the first film written and directed by Smith not to be set in the View Askewniverse as well as the first not to feature appearances by Jay and Silent Bob, although animated versions of the duo appear in the View Askew logo at the beginning of the film, as well as a still version of the logo at the end. At $35 million, it is Smith's biggest-budgeted film, and went on to underperform at the box office, grossing just $36 million.
