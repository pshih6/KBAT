Aggro Berlin was a German hip-hop independent record label based in Berlin, Germany that existed from 1 January 2001 until 1 April 2009. Three artists; Sido, Tony D and Kitty Kat were signed with the label at the time of its closure.
Since the end of 2007 it used to be a sub-label of Universal.
"Aggro" (in this context a noun) is German slang for having an aggressive attitude (as in British English).
