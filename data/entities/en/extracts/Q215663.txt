Christian, Count of Stolberg-Stolberg (15 October 1748 – 18 January 1821) poet, brother of Frederick Leopold, also a poet.
Born at Hamburg, he became a magistrate at Tremsbüttel in Holstein in 1777. Of the two brothers Frederick was undoubtedly the more talented. Christian though not a poet of high originality, excelled in the utterance of gentle sentiment.
They published together a volume of poems, Gedichte (edited by H. C. Boie, 1779); Schauspiele mit Chören (1787), their object in the latter work being to revive a love for the Greek drama; and a collection of patriotic poems Vaterländische Gedichte (1815).
Christian of Stolberg was the sole author of Gedichte aus dem Griechischen (1782), a translation of the works of Sophocles (1787) Die weisse Frau (1814) and of a poem in seven ballads, which last attained considerable popularity.
Stolberg was married to Louise Stolberg. He died in Windeby.
