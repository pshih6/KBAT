The Enumclaw horse sex case was a series of incidents in 2005 involving Kenneth Pinyan (1960â€“2005), an engineer who worked for Boeing and resided in Gig Harbor, Washington; James Michael Tait, a truck driver; and unidentified other men.  Pinyan and Tait filmed and distributed zoophilic pornography of Pinyan receiving anal sex from a stallion under the alias "Mr. Hands". After engaging in this activity on multiple occasions over an unknown span of time, Pinyan received fatal internal injuries in one such incident.
The story was reported in The Seattle Times and was one of that paper's most read stories of 2005.  It was informally referred to as the "Enumclaw horse sex case".Pinyan's death rapidly prompted the passing of a bill in Washington prohibiting both sex with animals and the videotaping of such an act. Under current Washington law, bestiality is now a Class C felony punishable by up to five years in prison.
