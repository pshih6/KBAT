Arthur and the Invisibles (French: Arthur et les Minimoys) is a 2006 French adventure comedy fantasy animated/live-action film adaptation of the 2002 children's book Arthur and the Minimoys, and the 2003 sequel Arthur and the Forbidden City, written by filmmaker Luc Besson, who also directed the film.
It premiered in limited release in France on 29 November 2006, and received wide releases in a number of countries in the following weeks. With a budget of €60 million, Arthur and the Invisibles was briefly the most expensive French film production until surpassed by Astérix at the Olympic Games.
The film received negative reviews from critics, and under-performed in the United States. It was nevertheless successful enough in France and in the rest of the world to generate two sequels, Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard and Arthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds. The film received the Imagina Award in the category Prix du Long-Métrage. The movie's soundtrack album was released on 9 January 2007.
