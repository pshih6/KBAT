Orlová (Czech pronunciation: [ˈorlovaː] (listen); Polish: Orłowa; German: Orlau) is a town in the Karviná District, Moravian-Silesian Region, Czech Republic. It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia.
The name is most probably possessive in origin, derived from the personal name Orel (Czech) (Orzeł in Polish), the same as eagle in English, although it may also be of topographic origins.
