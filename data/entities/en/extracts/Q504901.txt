Jerald Franklin "Jerry" terHorst (July 11, 1922 â€“ March 31, 2010) was an American journalist who served as the twelfth White House Press Secretary during the first month of Gerald Ford's presidency. His resignation in protest of Ford's unconditional pardon of former President Richard Nixon is still regarded as "a rare act of conscience by a high-ranking public official".
