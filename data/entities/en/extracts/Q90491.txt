Karl Wahl (24 September 1892 – 18 February 1981) was the Nazi Gauleiter of Swabia from the Gau inception in 1928 until the collapse of Nazi Germany in 1945.
After the war, Wahl spent 3½ years in jail before being released in late 1948. In 1954, he became the first former Gauleiter to publish his autobiography.
