The Golkar Party or Party of Functional Groups (Indonesian: Partai Golongan Karya) is a political party in Indonesia. It was founded as Sekber Golkar (Sekretariat Bersama Golongan Karya, Joint Secretariat of Functional Groups) in 1964, and participated for the first time in 1971 as Golkar (Golongan Karya, Functional Groups). At this point, Golkar was not a political party. In 1999, forced by the new election law, the groups reformed itself as a political party.
Golkar was the Indonesian ruling group from 1971 to 1999, under Presidents Suharto and B. J. Habibie. It subsequently join the ruling coalitions under presidents Abdurrahman Wahid, Megawati Sukarnoputri, and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. When President Joko Widodo of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle was elected in 2014, Golkar initially joined an opposition coalition led by former general Prabowo Subianto but in 2016 switched its allegiance to Widodo's government.
