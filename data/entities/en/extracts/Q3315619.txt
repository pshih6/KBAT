Min Shin Saw (Burmese: မင်းရှင်စော, pronounced [mɪ́ɴ ʃɪ̀ɴ sɔ́]; died 1167) was heir-apparent of the Pagan Dynasty of Burma (Myanmar) from c. 1117 to 1151. His father King Sithu I sent the crown prince into exile to present-day Ava (Inwa) where the prince subsequently turned into a highly cultivated region. After Sithu was assassinated in 1167, Min Shin Saw returned to Pagan to claim the throne. There, he was consecrated king but later that night, was assassinated by Narathu, his younger brother and the assassin of their father.
