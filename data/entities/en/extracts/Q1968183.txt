Donetsk National Technical University (DonNTU, formerly Donetsk Polytechnic Institute and other names) is the biggest and oldest higher education establishment in Donbas, founded in 1921. In its early years, it was attended by Nikita Khrushchev.
Following the loss of Ukrainian government control over Donetsk in 2014 during the war in Donbass, there are two competing institutions operating under this name. Ukrainian loyalist faculty relocated to Pokrovsk and are operating with Ukrainian accreditation. Pro-Russian faculty remained in the campus in Donetsk, and are operating under the Donetsk People's Republic.
