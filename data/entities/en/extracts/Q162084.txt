Torez (Ukrainian: Торез) or Chystiakove (Чистякове) is a city of regional significance in Donetsk Oblast of Ukraine. Much of the city's economy relies on mining industries, despite a recent drop in the number of employed miners. In 2012, the city's population was 81,761, down from a 1970 peak of about 120,000.
Pro-Russian separatists took control of Torez in June 2014. On July 17, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed near the city.
Torez was renamed from Chystyakove (Ukrainian: Чистякове) in 1964 in honor of French Communist Party leader Maurice Thorez, who died that year. The Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament), although Ukrainian authorities have no control over the city, renamed it back to Chystiakove in May 2016 due to Ukrainian decommunization laws.
