Mont Vélan is a mountain of the Pennine Alps, located on the border between Switzerland and Italy. At 3,727, metres Mont Vélan is the highest summit lying between the Great St Bernard Pass and Grand Combin. Two large glaciers cover its northern flanks: Glacier de Tseudet (west) and Glacier de Valsoray (east). The Glacier de Proz, lying on the west side, was traversed during the first ascent.
The mountain is located south of Bourg-Saint-Pierre in the canton of Valais and north of Etroubles in the Aosta Valley. The Petit Vélan is a lower summit in the same massif lying north to the main summit.
