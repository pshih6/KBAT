Blood of the Vampire is a 1958 British colour horror film directed by Henry Cass and starring Donald Wolfit, Barbara Shelley, and Vincent Ball. The film was produced by Robert S. Baker and Monty Berman for Tempean Films, from a screenplay by Jimmy Sangster.
Many horror fans thought the feature was a Hammer Films production when it came out, due to its similar look and Sangster's writer's credit. The film's U.S. release was in October 1958 as a double feature with Universal's Monster on the Campus.
The film's storyline, set in Transylvania, is about a scientist who uses the inmates of a prison for the criminally insane as sources for his gruesome blood-typing and -transfusion experiments that are keeping him alive.
