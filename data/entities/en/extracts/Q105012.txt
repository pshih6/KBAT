Gustav Neuring (1879 â€“ April 12, 1919) was a German politician. He died in a lynching.
Neuring was a member of Social Democratic Party of Germany. Following the German Revolution he served as the war minister (Kriegsminister) of the Free State of Saxony (Der Freistaat Sachsen). In April 1919 a mob of war veterans, upset by rumours that their war pensions will be cut, threw him into river Elbe in Dresden. When he tried to get up on the riverbank, Neuring was shot.
