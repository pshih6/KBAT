Heinrich Friedjung (January 18, 1851 – July 14, 1920) was an Austrian historian and journalist.
Friedjung was born in Roschtin (Czech: Roštín), Moravia (then, Austrian Empire; today, Czech Republic). The son of a Jewish family grew up in Vienna, and studied history in Prague and Berlin under Theodor Mommsen and Leopold von Ranke. He taught history and German language at the Commercial Academy (Handelsakademie) in Vienna from 1873 to 1879; he was then fired for criticizing the government.
He subsequently became active in politics, notably for his liberal and German-nationalistic views and support for the Greater German solution to the German question.
Friedjung died in Vienna.
