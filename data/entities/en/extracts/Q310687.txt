Niccolò Piccinni (Italian: [nikkoˈlɔ ppitˈtʃinni];  16 January [O.S. 5 January] 1728 - 7 May 1800) was an Italian composer of symphonies, sacred music, chamber music, and opera. Although he is somewhat obscure today, Piccinni was one of the most popular composers of opera—particularly the Neapolitan opera buffa—of his day.
