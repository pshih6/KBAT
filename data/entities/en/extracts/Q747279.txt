Mayors for Peace is an international organization of cities dedicated to the promotion of peace that was established in 1982 at the initiative of then Mayor of Hiroshima Takeshi Araki, in response to the deaths of around 140,000 people due to the atomic bombing of the city on August 6, 1945. 
The current mayor of Hiroshima, Kazumi Matsui, is the President of the organization as of his April 2011 inauguration.
Mayors for Peace was started in Japan, and since then Mayors throughout the World have signed on. When Mayors sign on, it means they support the commencement of negotiations towards the elimination of nuclear weapons by the year 2020.
In September 2015, Mayors for Peace counted around 6,800 member cities in 161 countries and territories around the world.
