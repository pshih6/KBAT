It was part of the Kingdom of Upper Burgundy until the death of 
Rudolph III of Burgundy (993-1032), also King of Lower Burgundy, the last in the male line, when it was united with the Holy Roman Empire. On 2 March 1476, during the Burgundian Wars, Charles the Bold was defeated here in the Battle of Grandson.
