Coronado lies on an island connected to the mainland by a tombolo called the Silver Strand. In 1602 the explorer Sebastian Vizcaino gave the island its name and drew its first map.  In 2012 Dr. Stephen Leatherman, Director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research, ranked Coronado Beach as the best beach in the United States.Coronado is Spanish for "crowned one," and thus it is nicknamed The Crown City. Three ships of the United States Navy have been named after the city, including USS Coronado.
