The Borrower is a 1991 American science fiction horror film directed by John McNaughton and starring Rae Dawn Chong, Tom Towles and Antonio Fargas. The story revolves around an alien serial killer, who is sent to Earth to live among humans as a form of penalty.
Tony Amendola has a small role as a doctor and MÃ¤dchen Amick briefly appears as a rock groupie. Pamela Norris cameos as a hooker. One of McNaughton's previous films (and one of the most well known and revered of his filmography), Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, is referenced in a poster that can be seen in one scene on the street and a commercial can be overheard warning about the disturbing nature of the film on a television during a scene in the hospital.
