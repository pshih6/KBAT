Laten John Adams Jr. (January 5, 1932 â€“ September 14, 1998), was an American blues, jazz and gospel singer, known as "The Tan Canary" for the multi-octave range of his singing voice, his swooping vocal mannerisms and falsetto.  His biggest hits were his versions of "Release Me" and "Reconsider Me" in the late 1960s.
