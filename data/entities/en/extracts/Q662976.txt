Paris II Panthéon-Assas University (French: Université Paris II Panthéon-Assas; [ynivɛʁsite pɑ̃teɔ̃ asas]), also referred to as Assas ([asas]) or Paris II ([paʁi dø]) is a research university specialized in law and economics in Paris, France. It is renowned for excellence in law and often described as the top law school in France. It is considered as the direct inheritor of the Faculty of Law and Economics of Paris (1257–1970) since, following the division of the University of Paris in 1970, most of its law professors (88 out of 108) choose to perpetuate the faculty by creating and joining a university of law and economics offering the same programs within the same two buildings. It currently provides law courses for Sorbonne University and may become its faculty of law.Since its founding in 1971, it has produced two presidents, four prime ministers, and the holders of thirty-seven other ministerships in France and around the world. Forty alumni of the university have been members of various parliaments as well. The majority of the nineteen campuses of Panthéon-Assas are located in the Latin Quarter, with the main campuses on Place du Panthéon and Rue d'Assas - hence its name. The university is composed of five departments specialising in law, journalism and media, economics, public and private management, and political science, and hosts twenty-four research centres and five specialized doctoral schools. Every year, the university enrolls approximately 18,000 students, including 3,000 international students.
