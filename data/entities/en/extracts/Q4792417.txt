Jane Arliss Sturgulewski (n√©e Wright; born September 27, 1927) is a retired businesswoman and Republican politician from the U.S. state of Alaska.  In a political career in which she started appearing in the spotlight in 1975, she represented Anchorage in the Alaska Senate from 1979 to 1993.  Twice during off-years in re-election to her four-year Senate term (in 1986 and 1990), she won the Republican nomination for governor of Alaska against mostly conservative opposition in blanket primaries.  The second time, in 1990, she came out in third place behind Walter Hickel and runner up Tony Knowles, which was the second of three times in Alaska's history a major-party nominee placed third.  She won a 2000 Anchorage Athena award.
