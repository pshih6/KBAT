Valentin Senger (28 December 1918, in Frankfurt – 4 September 1997, in Frankfurt) was a German author and journalist. He is best known for his 1978 autobiography, Kaiserhofstraße 12, recounting his childhood at the central Frankfurt street Kaiserhofstraße as the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants who survived the Nazi era undetected. The book appeared in English in 1980 under the title The Invisible Jew, and was adapted into a motion picture in the same year.
