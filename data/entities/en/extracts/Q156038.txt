The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (Latin: Ducatus Curlandiæ et Semigalliæ; Polish: Księstwo Kurlandii i Semigalii; German: Herzogtum Kurland und Semgallen; Latvian: Kurzemes un Zemgales hercogiste) was a duchy in the Baltic region that existed from 1561 to 1569 as a vassal state of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and from 1569 to 1726 of the Crown of the Polish Kingdom, incorporated into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by Sejm in 1726. On 28 March 1795, it was annexed by the Russian Empire in the Third Partition of Poland.
There was also a short-lived wartime state existing from 8 March to 22 September 1918 with the same name. Plans for it to become part of the United Baltic Duchy, subject to the German Empire, were thwarted by Germany's surrender of the Baltic region at the end of the First World War.  The area became a part of Latvia at the end of World War I.
