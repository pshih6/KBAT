Ehsan Aman (Persian: احسان امان‎ – Eḥsān Amān; born 1959) is an Afghan American singer. He is one of the few veterans of Afghanistan’s lost music Golden Age who've maintained their popularity over the decades. He gained fame in Afghanistan during 1970s and early 1980s with his first singles and the performances he held at Kabul University. Exiled since the early 80s in the US, he has continued writing and producing music in the state of Virginia, which has also been his residence since that time.
Aman is married to the daughter of songwriter Nainawaz.
