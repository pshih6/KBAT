DeWitt Clinton High School is a public high school located since 1929 in The Bronx, New York, United States. Opened in 1897 in Lower Manhattan and initially operated as an all-boys school, it maintained that status for nearly 100 years. In 1983 it became co-ed.  From its original building on West 13th Street in Manhattan, it moved in 1906 to its second home on 59th Street and Tenth Avenue (now the site of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice). In 1929 the school moved to its present home on Mosholu Parkway in the Bronx.
After more than a century of operations, producing a raft of accomplished alumni, DeWitt Clinton High School in the early 21st century has faced serious problems involving student performance and security.
