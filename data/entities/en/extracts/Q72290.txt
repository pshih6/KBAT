Nikolaus von Vormann (24 December 1895  â€“ 26 October 1959) was a German general who served in the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany.
General von Vormann was born in Neumark, West Prussia, German Empire. He joined the Prussian Army in 1914 and served in World War I and remained in the Weimar German Reichswehr. In World War II he served on the Eastern Front campaigns and in 1944 briefly commanded the 9th Army. During this brief interval, he became involved in the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising, although the main responsibility for the wanton destruction of the Polish capital and the massacre of its inhabitants laid with the SS-generals Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski and Heinz Reinefarth. On 4 May 1945, as the Allies approached during the closing days of World War II, von Vormann's last appointment was as commander of the largely non-existent "Alpenfestung" (Alpine Fortress). He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Vormann wrote two books documenting his war-time experiences: Der Feldzug 1939 in Polen and Tscherkassy. He died on 26 October 1959 in Berchtesgaden.
