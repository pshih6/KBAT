Sári Fedák (26 October 1879, Beregszász (present-day Berehove, Ukraine) – 25 May 1955, Budapest, Hungary) was a Hungarian actress and singer, one of the most well-known prima donnas of her time. According to American journalist and non-fiction writer Richard Traubner, Fedák and Sári Petráss remain "the two best-remembered Hungarian female operetta stars of all time".
