De Wereld Draait Door (English: "The world keeps on turning") was an early-evening talk show on Dutch television, broadcast every weekday at 7:00 p.m. on NPO 1. It is the Netherlands' longest-running, regularly scheduled TV entertainment show and is also the program with the second-highest viewing figures on Dutch television, beaten only by the main evening news at 8.00 p.m. The show, created by Dieuwke Wynia and produced by BNNVARA, was discontinued after the last episode on March 27, 2020.
