The 4th arrondissement of Paris (IVe arrondissement) is one of the 20 arrondissements of the capital city of France. In spoken French, this arrondissement is referred to as quatrième.
The arrondissement, also known as Hôtel-de-Ville, is situated on the right bank of the River Seine.
The 4th arrondissement contains the Renaissance-era Paris City Hall, rebuilt between 1874 and 1882. It also contains the Renaissance square of Place des Vosges, the overtly modern Pompidou Centre, and the lively southern part of the medieval district of Le Marais, which today is known for being the gay district of Paris. (The quieter northern part of Le Marais is within the 3rd arrondissement). The eastern parts of the Île de la Cité (including Notre-Dame de Paris) as well as the Île Saint-Louis are also included within the 4th arrondissement.
The 4th arrondissement is known for its little streets, cafés, and shops but is often regarded by Parisians as expensive and congested. It is desirable for those wanting old buildings and a mix of many cultures.
