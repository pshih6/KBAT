See also Stanisław Albrecht Radziwiłł.Stanisław "the Pious" Radziwiłł (Lithuanian: Stanislovas Radvila II) (May 12, 1559 – March 19, 1599) was a sixth generation Radziwill family noble (szlachcic) of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was a general starost (elder) of the Duchy of Samogitia (Samaiten, from 1595 until his death), a first ordynat of Olyka, and the Great Lithuanian Marshal (from 1592 until his death).
He was the son of Mikołaj "the Black" Radziwiłł and Elżbieta Szydłowiecka. Raised as a Calvinist, he converted to Roman Catholicism and was known as a very pious person, which gained him the nickname Pobożny (Pious). He was also known for his scholarly interests - he collected books and could read in many languages. He avoided politics, but fought in the wars with Muscovy under the Polish king Stefan Batory. He built most of the Olyka Castle.
