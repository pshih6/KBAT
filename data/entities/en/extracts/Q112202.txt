Fritz Heider (19 February 1896 â€“ 2 January 1988) was an Austrian psychologist whose work was related to the Gestalt school. In 1958 he published The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations, which expanded upon his creations of balance theory and attribution theory. This book presents a wide-range analysis of the conceptual framework and the psychological processes that influence human social perception (Malle,2008). It had taken 15 years to complete; before it was completed it had already circulated through a small group of social psychologists.
