Prince Vincenz of Liechtenstein, known in Austria as Vincenz Liechtenstein, (30 July 1950 in Graz – 14 January 2008 in Deutschfeistritz, Styria) was an Austrian politician (ÖVP). He was a grandson of Charles I of Austria, the last Austrian Emperor. He was born a Prince of Liechtenstein. He never renounced his succession to the Liechtensteiner throne, but since the nobility in Austria was officially abolished in 1919 after the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he did not use his princely title or honorific (Serene Highness) in his Austrian civic life.
