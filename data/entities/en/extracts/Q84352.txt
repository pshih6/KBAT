André Gorz (né Gerhart Hirsch; born 9 February 1923 – 22 September 2007), more commonly known by his pen names Gérard Horst and Michel Bosquet, was an Austrian and French social philosopher and journalist.
He co-founded Le Nouvel Observateur weekly in 1964. A supporter of Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialist version of Marxism after the Second World War, he became in the aftermath of the May '68 student riots more concerned with political ecology.
In the 1960s and 1970s he was a main theorist in the New Left movement. His central theme was wage labour issues such as liberation from work, the just distribution of work, social alienation, and a guaranteed basic income.
