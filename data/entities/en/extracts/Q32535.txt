That's My Boy is a 2012 American satirical comedy film directed by Sean Anders and starring Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg. The film follows Donny (Sandler), a middle aged alcoholic who once enjoyed celebrity status for being at the center of a teacher-student sexual abuse case, as he tries to rekindle his relationship with his adult son Todd (Samberg), born as the result of sexual abuse, in hopes that their reunion will earn him enough money to avoid going to prison for tax evasion.
The film was released on June 15, 2012, by Columbia Pictures, and despite a sizable budget for a comedy film and a cast made of well known actors, comedians, and celebrities, the film was both a critical and financial failure, grossing just $57 million against a $70 million budget. Further damaging the film's financial health was accusations of homophobic and misogynistic writing and criticism for its comedic treatment of child sexual abuse, rape, incest, and child neglect. Film critic Richard Roeper gave the film an F, calling it "an ugly, tasteless, deadly and mean-spirited piece of filmmaking," and would later call it the worst film of 2012. John Hanlon of Rotten Tomatoes certified it rotten, saying it was "easily the worst movie of 2012." Some consider it to be one of the worst films ever made.
