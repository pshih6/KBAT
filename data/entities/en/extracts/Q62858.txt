Uwe Barschel (13 May 1944 â€“ 11 October 1987) was a West German politician belonging to the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) who served as Minister-President in the state of Schleswig-Holstein. Barschel was found dead under mysterious circumstances on 11 October 1987, when his clothed body was discovered in a full bathtub at the Hotel Beau-Rivage in Geneva, Switzerland, shortly after he became embroiled in scandal during the 1987 federal election. While a police investigation concluded that Barschel had committed suicide, the circumstances of his death remain controversial.
