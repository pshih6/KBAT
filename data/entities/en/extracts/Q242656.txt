Edith Madeleine Carroll (26 February 1906 â€“ 2 October 1987) was an English actress, popular both in Britain and America in the 1930s and 1940s.  At the peak of her success in 1938, she was the world's highest-paid actress.
Carroll is remembered for her role in Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps (1935). She is also noted for largely abandoning her acting career after the death of her sister Marguerite in the London Blitz to devote herself to helping wounded servicemen and children displaced or maimed by the war.
