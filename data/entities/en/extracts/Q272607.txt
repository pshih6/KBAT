Tullia Zevi (née Calabi) (2 February 1919 – 22 January 2011) was an Italian journalist and writer.  Zevi's family fled Italy to France and then to the US after the rise of fascism in the 1930s. While in New York City, she married Bruno Zevi.  She returned to Europe in 1946, and was one of the few women journalists to report the Nuremberg Trials. On her return to Italy, she played a major role in Interfaith dialog, and was active in Italian Centre-left politics.  Zevi was president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities from 1983 to 1998.
