The ghazal (Arabic: غَزَل‎, Bengali: গজল, Sylheti: ꠊꠏꠟ, Punjabi: ਗ਼ਜ਼ਲ, Urdu: غزَل, Nepali: गजल, Hindi: ग़ज़ल, Persian: غزل‎, Azerbaijani: qəzəl, Turkish: gazel, Uzbek: gʻazal, Pashto: غزل‎, Gujarati: ગઝલ,) is a form of amatory poem or ode, originating in Arabic poetry. A ghazal may be understood as a poetic expression of both the pain of loss or separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain.The ghazal form is ancient, tracing its origins to 7th-century Arabic poetry. The ghazal spread into South Asia  in the 12th century due to the influence of Sufi mystics and the courts of the new Islamic Sultanate, and is now most prominently a form of poetry of many languages of the Indian subcontinent and Turkey.A ghazal commonly consists of between five and fifteen couplets, which are independent, but are linked – abstractly, in their theme; and more strictly in their poetic form. The structural requirements of the ghazal are similar in stringency to those of the Petrarchan sonnet. In style and content, due to its highly allusive nature, the ghazal has proved capable of an extraordinary variety of expression around its central themes of love and separation.
