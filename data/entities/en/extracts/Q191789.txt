Martha Washington (née Dandridge; June 13  [O.S. June 2] 1731 – May 22, 1802) was the wife of George Washington, the first President of the United States.  Although the title was not coined until after her death, Martha Washington served as the inaugural First Lady of the United States. During her lifetime she was often referred to as "Lady Washington".She had first married Daniel Parke Custis, with whom she had four children, and was widowed by the age of 25. Two of her children by Custis survived to young adulthood. She brought her vast wealth to her marriage to Washington, which enabled him to buy land to add to his personal estate.  She also brought nearly 1000 dower slaves for her use during her lifetime. They and their descendants reverted to her first husband's estate at her death and were inherited by his heirs. She and Washington did not have children together but they did rear her two surviving children by Daniel Parke Custis, including son John "Jacky" Parke Custis. They also helped both of their extended families.
