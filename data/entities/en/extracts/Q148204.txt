Heaven's Gate is a 1980 American epic Western film written and directed by Michael Cimino. Loosely based on the Johnson County War, it portrays a fictional dispute between land barons and European immigrants in Wyoming in the 1890s. The film features an ensemble cast, including Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken, Isabelle Huppert, Jeff Bridges, John Hurt, Sam Waterston, Brad Dourif, Joseph Cotten, Geoffrey Lewis, David Mansfield, Richard Masur, Terry O'Quinn, Mickey Rourke, Willem Dafoe and Nicholas Woodeson, the last two in their first film roles. It is notable for being one of the biggest box office bombs of all time, losing the studio an estimated $37 million ($144 million in 2019 dollars); it was at one point considered one of the worst films ever made.There were major setbacks in the film's production due to cost overruns, endless retakes, negative press (including allegations of animal abuse on-set) and rumors about Cimino's allegedly authoritarian directorial style; the film resultantly opened to scathing reviews, earning only $3.5 million domestically (from an estimated $44 million budget), eventually contributing to the management problems of its parent studio, United Artists, and effectively destroying Cimino's reputation as a filmmaker, previously a rising auteur from the success of his 1978 film The Deer Hunter, winner of the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director in 1979. Cimino had an expensive and ambitious vision, pushing the film nearly four times over its planned budget. Its resulting financial problems and United Artists' consequent demise led to a move away from the 1970s period of director-driven film production in the American film industry, back toward greater studio control of films, as had been predominant in Hollywood until the late 1960s.In the decades since the release, however, general assessment of Heaven's Gate has become more positive. The 1980 re-edit has been characterized as "one of the greatest injustices of cinematic history" and later re-edits have received critical acclaim. The BBC ranked Heaven's Gate 98th on their 100 greatest American films of all-time list.
