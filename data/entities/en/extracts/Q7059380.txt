Northfield Mount Hermon School, commonly referred to as NMH, is a co-educational college-preparatory school for both boarding and day students in grades 9â€“12 and postgraduates. NMH is a selective school with an acceptance rate of 32%. The school is located on the banks of the Connecticut River, with the majority of the campus being located within the towns of Bernardston, Northfield, (West Northfield), and Gill, Massachusetts.
