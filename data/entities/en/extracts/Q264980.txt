Equal Vision Records is an independent record label based in Albany, New York. Equal Vision Records was founded in the early 1990s by Ray Cappo, singer for the bands Youth of Today, Shelter, and Better Than a Thousand.
The label originally existed solely to distribute Shelter and other Krishna releases. In 1992, label manager Steve Reddy bought Equal Vision from Cappo. The focus was expanded and a wider variety of bands were brought on board. According to Punk News, "The mid-to-late '90s saw a redoubling of the Equal Vision's hardcore efforts with such signings as One King Down and Ten Yard Fight. By the end of the '90s Equal Vision Records (EVR) found itself with an impressive stable of hardcore and punk bands, having added Bane, Trial, Converge and Saves the Day to its roster in the latter part of the decade."
