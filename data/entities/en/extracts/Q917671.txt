Brisbane (pron.  BRIZ-bayn, unlike Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, pron.  BRIZ-ben) is a small city located in California in the northern part of San Mateo County on the lower slopes of San Bruno Mountain.  It is located on the southern border of San Francisco, on the northeastern edge of South San Francisco, next to San Francisco Bay and near San Francisco International Airport. The population was 4,282 as of the 2010 census.
Brisbane is called "The City of Stars" because of a holiday tradition established over 69 years ago. At the start of the Christmas/Hanukkah season, many residents and business owners place large, illuminated stars, some as big as 10 feet (3.0 m) or more in diameter, on the downhill sides of homes and offices throughout Brisbane.  Many of the stars are kept up all year.
