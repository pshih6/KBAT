The Royal Academy of Art (KABK, Dutch: Koninklijke Academie van Beeldende Kunsten) is a renowned art and design academy in The Hague. Succeeding the Haagsche Teeken-Academie (part of the Confrerie Pictura), the academy was founded on 29 September 1682, making it the oldest in the Netherlands and one of the oldest in the world. The academy has been the training ground for a number of significant artists of the Hague School. It was part of the art movement of Dutch Impressionism and in the immediate vicinity of the II. Golden Age of Dutch painting. In the 19th century, however, training was still strongly oriented towards the classic curriculum. At the end of the 19th century, the academy had opened to Modernism, too.
