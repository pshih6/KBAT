Gregory James Norton (born 13 March 1959) is an American musician, formerly of the band Hüsker Dü. While the majority of the band's songwriting was done by bandmates Bob Mould and Grant Hart, Norton contributed the songs  "M.T.C.," "Don't Have a Life" and "Let's Go Die" to Hüsker Dü's debut EP Land Speed Record. He was born in Davenport, Iowa.
After Hüsker Dü disbanded in 1988, Norton formed the band Grey Area with Hüsker Dü engineer and former member of Fine Art Colin Mansfield as well as Jo Jones. After Grey Area disbanded in 1991, Norton left the music business to focus on the restaurant business, opening The Norton's Restaurant (now closed) in Red Wing, Minnesota. Norton returned to the recording industry in 2006, with a new jazz band, Gang Font feat. Interloper. The group is composed of Norton, Dave King (of The Bad Plus, Happy Apple, Halloween, Alaska, 12 Rods and the Love-Cars), Eric Fratzke of Zebulon Pike and Happy Apple, and Craig Taborn.
In 2016, Norton joined La Crosse, Wisconsin band Porcupine as their bass player to replace Davey Reinders.
