Andrew Talcott (1797â€“1883) was an American civil engineer and close friend of Civil War General Robert E. Lee. He did not serve during the Civil War, as he could not fight against the Union, nor fight against his brothers in the South. He traveled to  Veracruz to work on the Railroad. Coming back with the President to New York for supplies he was arrested and placed at Fort Layfayette accused of being a spy for the Confederate States of America. He was moved to Fort Adams in Boston under orders of General John E Wool. General John A Dix was placed in the command of the Eastern Military Department. Knowing Captain Andrew well and believing his loyalty to the Union he was released.
