The National Democratic Party (Arabic: الحزب الوطني الديمقراطي‎ Al-Ḥizb Al-Waṭanī Ad-Dīmūqrāṭī), often simply called in Arabic: الحزب الوطني‎ Al-Ḥizb al-Waṭaniy – the "National Party", was a centrist political party in Egypt. It was founded by President Anwar El Sadat in 1978.The NDP wielded uncontested power in state politics, usually considered a de facto single party with authoritarian characteristics inside an officially multi-party system, from its creation until the resignation of Sadat's successor Hosni Mubarak in response to the Egyptian Revolution of 2011.
The National Democratic Party was an authoritarian centrist party. From its inception, it was by far the most powerful of the parties to emerge from the Arab Socialist Union (ASU), the former ruling sole party since 1962 and was as such seen as its organic successor. However, in contrast to ASU's strong emphasis on Arab nationalism and Arab socialism (see: Nasserism), the NDP developed into a moderate centrist party. The NDP was a member of the Socialist International from 1989, until it was expelled in 2011, in response to the revolution.The party was dissolved on 16 April 2011 by court order, and its assets were transferred to the state.
