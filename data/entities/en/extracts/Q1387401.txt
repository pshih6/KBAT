Trevor Graham Baylis  (13 May 1937 â€“ 5 March 2018) was an English inventor best known for the wind-up radio. The radio, instead of relying on batteries or external electrical source, is powered by the user winding a crank. This stores energy in a spring which then drives an electrical generator. Baylis invented it in response to the need to communicate information about AIDS to the "people of Africa". He ran a company in his name dedicated to helping inventors to develop and protect their ideas and to find a route to market.
