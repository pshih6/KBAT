Aelia Eudocia Augusta (; Late Greek: Αἰλία Εὐδοκία Αὐγούστα; c. 401 – 460 AD), also called Saint Eudocia, was a Greek Eastern Roman Empress by marriage to Byzantine emperor Theodosius II (r. 408–450).
Eudocia lived in a world where Greek paganism and Christianity existed side-by-side with both pagans and non-orthodox Christians being persecuted. Although Eudocia's work has been mostly ignored by modern scholars, her poetry and literary work are emblematic of how her Christian faith and Greek heritage were intertwined.
