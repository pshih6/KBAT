The Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics (Russian: Институт прикладной математики им. М.В.Келдыша) is a research institute specializing in computational mathematics. It was established to solve computational tasks related to government programs of nuclear and fusion energy, space research and missile technology. The Institute is a part of the Department of Mathematical Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The main direction of activity of the institute is the use of computer technology to solve complex scientific and technical issues of practical importance. Since 2016, development of mathematical and computational methods for biological research, as well as a direct solution to the problems of computational biology with the use of such methods, has also been included in the circle of scientific activities of the institute.
