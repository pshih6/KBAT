Giacomo Torelli (1 September 1608 â€“ 17 June 1678) was an Italian stage designer, engineer, and architect.  His work in stage design, particularly his designs of machinery for creating spectacular scenery changes and other special effects, was extensively engraved and hence survives as the most complete record of mid-seventeenth-century set design.
