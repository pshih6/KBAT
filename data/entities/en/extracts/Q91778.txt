Otto Kühne (12 May 1893, in Berlin – 8 December 1955, in Brandenburg an der Havel) was a German communist militant, who led a maquis group of German antifascist fighters in the French region of Lozère in 1943 and 1944 during World War II.
A railwayman by profession, Kühne had been a communist deputy during the Reichstag fire, and had subsequently fled to France.
