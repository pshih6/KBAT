Friedrich Christian Laukhard (7 June 1757 â€“ 28 April 1822) was a German novelist, philosopher, historian and theologian.
From 1783 to 1794 he volunteered in the Prussian army as a musketeer. During the War of the first coalition his regiment (v. Thadden) campaigned in Valmy.
Laukhard's military diary is of great interest for historical research on the Prussian army and the French revolutionary wars. 
Due to his licentious and extrovert lifestyle, "Magister Laukhard" soon became a notorious figure.
