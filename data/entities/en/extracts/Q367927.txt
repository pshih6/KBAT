John Davis Lodge (October 20, 1903 â€“ October 29, 1985) was an American lawyer, actor, politician, and diplomat. He was the 79th Governor of Connecticut from 1951 to 1955, and later served as U.S. Ambassador to Spain, Argentina, and Switzerland. As an actor, he was often credited simply as John Lodge. He had roles in four Hollywood films between 1933 and 1935, including playing Marlene Dietrich's lover in The Scarlet Empress and Shirley Temple's father in The Little Colonel. He starred or co-starred in many British and European films between 1935 and 1940.
Lodge was a member of four prominent political families in the Northeast U.S.: the Cabot, Lodge, Frelinghuysen and Davis families. He was a direct descendant of at least seven U.S. senators, and had many other politicians in his family, including his brother, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr..
