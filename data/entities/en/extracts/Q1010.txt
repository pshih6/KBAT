Maribor (UK:  MARR-ib-or, US:  MAR-, Slovene: [ˈmáːɾibɔɾ] (listen); also known by other historical names) is the second-largest city in Slovenia and the largest city of the traditional region of Lower Styria. It is also the seat of the City Municipality of Maribor, the seat of the Drava statistical region and the Eastern Slovenia region. Maribor is also the economic, administrative, educational and cultural centre of eastern Slovenia.
Maribor was first mentioned as a castle in 1164, as a settlement in 1209 and as a city in 1254. As most of Slovene lands, Maribor was under Habsburg rule until 1918 when Rudolf Maister and his men secured the city for the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs which was later renamed to Yugoslavia. In 1991 Maribor became part of independent Slovenia.
Maribor, along with the Portuguese city of Guimarães, was selected the European Capital of Culture for 2012.
