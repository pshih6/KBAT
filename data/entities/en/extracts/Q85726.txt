Richard Specht (7 December 1870, Vienna - 19 March 1932) was an Austrian lyricist, dramatist, musicologist and writer. 
Specht is most well known for his writings on classical music, and in his time was seen as a leading music journalist.  He was a great authority on the music of Gustav Mahler, and in later life became a regular acquaintance of his widow, Alma Mahler-Werfel.
He was, amongst other things, a contributor to the Wiener Illustrierten Extrablatts and other Viennese newspapers.  From 1910, he worked at the Merker publishing house.  In 1925, he was appointed to a professorship at the institution that is now the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna.
