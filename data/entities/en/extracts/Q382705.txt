Blue Puppy (Russian: Голубой щенок, translit. Goluboy shchenok, alternative translations - Pale Blue Puppy/Slate puppy) is a 1976 Soviet animated film. The lyrics and screenplay were written by Yuri Entin, loosely based on the tale by Gyula Urban.
Several quotes from the film's lyrics became common colloquial sayings, for example, "What trouble can we stir up?" and "Ah, how I'm angry, ooh, how I'm angry!" voiced by Mikhail Boyarsky, and the phrase "One ought to live skilfully."
The film was unique in utilizing a non-traditional animation technique where spots of colorful India ink were used to form the characters. This gave a great deal of plasticity to the animated characters. For example, the Black Cat would vanish from the foreground only to reappear immediately in the back, or the evil Pirate would transform into a thundercloud by inflating himself with his own malice.
