Charro! is a 1969 American western film starring Elvis Presley shot on location at Apacheland Movie Ranch and Old Tucson Studios in Arizona.  Uniquely, Presley did not sing on-screen, and the film featured no songs at all except for the main title theme, which was played over the opening credits.  It was also the only movie in which Presley wore a beard.  The film was novelized by Harry Whittington.Ina Balin, Victor French, Barbara Werle, and Solomon Sturges co-starred.  It was the final film for director Charles Marquis Warren who also produced and wrote it.  It was also the only Presley film distributed by National General Pictures. The film made a profit but was not a runaway success, and remains one of Presley's least-seen films despite being regarded among his best in terms of a 'straight' (non-musical) acting performance.
