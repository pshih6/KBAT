It is the story of a sexually curious and rebellious 14-year-old (played by 16-year-old Zentout) who has an emotionally charged and dually manipulative relationship with an aging playboy.
Breillat is known for films focusing on sexuality, intimacy, gender conflict and sibling rivalry. Breillat has been the subject of controversy for her explicit depictions of sexuality. Zentout had many topless, nude and explicit scenes in the movie.
