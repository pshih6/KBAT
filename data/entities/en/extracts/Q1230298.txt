La Croix (French pronunciation: ​[laˈkʁwa]; English: The Cross) is a daily French general-interest Roman Catholic newspaper. It is published in Paris and distributed throughout France, with a circulation of 87,000 as of 2018. It is not explicitly left or right on major political issues; rather, the newspaper adopts the Church's position. However, La Croix ought not be confused with a religious newspaper—its topics are of general interest: world news, the economy, religion and spirituality, parenting, culture and science.
