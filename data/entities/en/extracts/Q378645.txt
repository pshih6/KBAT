Carlo Emilio Gadda (Italian pronunciation: [ˈkarlo eˈmiːljo ˈɡadda]; November 14, 1893 – May 21, 1973) was an Italian writer and poet. He belongs to the tradition of the language innovators, writers that played with the somewhat stiff standard pre-war Italian language, and added elements of dialects, technical jargon and wordplay.
