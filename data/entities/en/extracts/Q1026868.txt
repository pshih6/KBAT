California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona, CPP, or Cal Poly) is a public polytechnic university in Pomona, California. It is one of two polytechnic universities in the California State University system.
Cal Poly Pomona began as the southern campus of the California Polytechnic School (today known as Cal Poly San Luis Obispo) in 1938 when the Voorhis School for Boys and its adjacent farm in the city of San Dimas were donated by Charles Voorhis and his son Jerry Voorhis. Cal Poly's southern campus grew further in 1949 when the University of California, W.K. Kellogg Institute also known as W.K. Kellogg Institute of Animal Husbandryâ€”University of California, Pomona in the neighboring city of Pomona, which had belonged to Will Keith Kellogg, was acquired from the University of California. Cal Poly Pomona, then known as Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis, and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo continued operations under a unified administrative control until they became independent from one another in 1966.
