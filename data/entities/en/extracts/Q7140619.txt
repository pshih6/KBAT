Partisan Records is an independent record label with offices in London and Los Angeles, as well as in New York City, where the company was co-founded in 2007 by Tim Putnam and Ian Wheeler.  The label, initially run out of Putnam’s South Brooklyn apartment, relocated in 2009 to their flagship office in Williamsburg where they still reside.  Holy Sons (‘Decline Of The West’) was the first release on the label, and early success followed shortly thereafter with the release of Deer Tick (‘War Elephant’). In 2008, while working as the Night Manager for The Knitting Factory venue at their Leonard St. location in Manhattan, Putnam was approached by Knitting Factory Entertainment CEO Morgan Margolis to form a strategic partnership with Partisan.  Together they've reissued the Fela Kuti catalogue and revived their label, Knitting Factory Records, which also includes Grammy Award-nominated members of the Kuti family, Femi Kuti and Seun Kuti. Partisan has since cultivated an eclectic, diverse roster across all genres, prioritizing an artist-friendly philosophy, and achieving international acclaim.  In 2018 they achieved a Top 5 UK chart position as well as a ‘British Breakthrough’ nomination at the BRIT Awards in 2019 for Joy as an Act of Resistance by IDLES . Partisan then earned their first-ever Grammy nomination for ‘Deran’ by Bombino;  two Mercury Prize nominations for IDLES and Fontaines D.C.'s debut album 'Dogrel';  an Ivor Novello prize for IDLES; AIM UK, A2IM, and Music Business Worldwide A+R Awards for Independent Label of the Year; and Music Week’s International Woman of The Year award for Partisan's Managing Director, Zena White. Putnam now serves as President of Partisan, and Wheeler manages The Talkhouse, which he founded in 2015 and shares an office with Partisan.
