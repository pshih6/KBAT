Ernst Wilhelm Julius Bornemann (April 12, 1915 â€“ June 4, 1995), also known by his self-chosen anglicisation Ernest Borneman, was a German crime writer, filmmaker, anthropologist, ethnomusicologist, psychoanalyst, sexologist, communist agitator, jazz musician and critic. All these diverse interests, he claimed, had a common root in his lifelong insatiable curiosity. From 1982 to 1986 he was president of the German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research. In 1990 he was awarded the Magnus Hirschfeld Medal for sexual science. From the 1990s onwards, he has been criticized for having made a contribution to the sexualisation of children through passages in his work advocating for sexual intercourse between children and adults.
