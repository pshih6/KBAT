The Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering is an independent thinktank that helps Australians understand and use technology to solve complex problems. It was founded in 1975 as one of Australia's four learned Academies.
Its original name was the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences but in 1987 the name was extended, with the addition of Engineering.
In 2015, the Academy adopted a new business name, the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering, reserving the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering as its company name.
In 2018, the Academy changed its brandmark from ATSE to Applied, to avoid the confusion caused by the acronym and to reaffirm the Academy's origins in applied science and technology.
