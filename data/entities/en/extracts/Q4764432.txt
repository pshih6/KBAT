Ania Walwicz (born 1951) is a contemporary Australian poet and prose writer, and visual artist.
Ania Walwicz was born in Swidnica, Poland where she spent her childhood, before migrating to Australia in 1963. She attended the Victorian College of the Arts (VCA) in Melbourne. Her writing tends toward an impressionistic, stream of consciousness exploration of inner states. It also exploits 'appropriative' or 'sampling' techniques of production. Apart from publication in numerous anthologies, journals and several books, her work has been performed by La Mama Theatre, the Sydney Chamber Choir and more recently set to music by ChamberMade. She has performed her work in France, Japan and Switzerland and currently teaches creative writing at RMIT in Melbourne.
