John Arthur Doucette (January 21, 1921 â€“ August 16, 1994) was an American character actor who performed in more than 280 film and television productions between 1941 and 1987. A man of stocky build who possessed a deep, rich voice, he proved equally adept at portraying characters in Shakespearean plays as well as in Westerns and in modern crime dramas. He is perhaps best remembered, however, for his villainous roles as a movie and television "tough guy".
