Georges Aperghis (Greek: Γιώργος Απέργης; born 23 December 1945) is a Greek composer working primarily in the field of experimental musical theater but has also composed a large amount of non-programmatic chamber music. He lives in France and was married to actress Édith Scob until 2019 when she died.
Aperghis studied with Iannis Xenakis and founded the music and theater company ATEM (Atelier Théâtre et Musique). He was a "composer in residence" in Strasbourg, France.
In 2011 he was the first recipient of the Mauricio Kagel Music Prize. Aperghis is honored with the 2015 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Contemporary Music for his reinvention of music theater, using sound, gesture, space and technology and involving performers in the compositional process.
