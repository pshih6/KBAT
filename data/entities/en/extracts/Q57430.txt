Carl Friedrich Goerdeler (31 July 1884 â€“ 2 February 1945) was a monarchist conservative German politician, executive, economist, civil servant and opponent of the Nazi regime. He opposed some of the anti-Jewish policies while he held office and was opposed to the Holocaust.
Had the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler of 1944 succeeded, Goerdeler would have served as the Chancellor of the new government. After his arrest, he gave names of numerous co-conspirators to the Gestapo, causing the arrests and executions of hundreds or even thousands of others. He was executed by hanging on 2 February 1945.
