became one of the architects of the Jini architecture at Sun Microsystems.Bob has stated that his goal in developing the X Window System was to raise the floor in windowing systems for the entire market, and despite its early adoption primarily by commercial players with proprietary extensions, X ended up as a standard, open system.
