Lalaine Vergara-Paras (born June 3, 1987), known mononymously as Lalaine, is an American actress, singer-songwriter, and bassist. She is best known for her roles as Miranda Sanchez in Lizzie McGuire, Kate in Annie, and Abby Ramirez in You Wish!.
After appearing in the roles of Young Cosette and Éponine in a Broadway musical production of Les Misérables as a child, Lalaine pursued a career in music. She signed with Warner Bros. Records following the end of Lizzie McGuire and released one studio album and one extended play, both of which saw little commercial success mostly due to only having a limited release.
