The Cementerio de Nuestra Señora de La Almudena (English: Our Lady of Almudena Cemetery), former Necrópolis de Este (East cemetery) is a cemetery in Madrid, Spain. It is the largest in Madrid and one of the largest in Western Europe. The number of people buried is estimated to be about five million, larger than the population of Madrid itself, since it was the main cemetery for the entire city from 1884 to 1973, and from the 1920s was almost the only one for the majority of the population of Madrid.
