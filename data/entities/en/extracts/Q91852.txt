Walter Reuter (b. January 4, 1906 - March 20, 2005) was a Mexican photojournalist of German origin. Reuter arrived to Mexico in 1942, after fleeing the rise of the Nazis in Germany, and the defeat of the Republicans in Spain. Having started his career in Europe, he introduced modern photojournalism techniques into Mexico and is best known for his work documenting twenty ethnicities of Mexico's indigenous people.  In 1986, the Museo de Arte Moderno held a retrospective of his work and he was a member of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana. Since his death, a collection of his work has been published and exhibited.
