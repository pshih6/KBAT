The Producers is a 1967 American satirical black comedy film written and directed by Mel Brooks and starring Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, Dick Shawn, and Kenneth Mars. The film is about a theater producer and his accountant who, as part of a scam, have to stage the worst stage musical they can create. They eventually base it on Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. Because of this theme The Producers was controversial from the start   and received mixed reviews. It became a cult movie  and found a more positive critical reception later. 
The Producers was Brooks's directorial debut. For the film, he won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. 25 years later, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry and placed eleventh on the AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list. It was later adapted by Brooks and Thomas Meehan as a stage musical, which itself was adapted into a film.
