The band is composed of two primary members, Riya—who provided vocals and the majority of the lyrics—and Hajime Kikuchi—who plays the keyboard and handles composition, arrangement, and sometimes the lyrics. The third member is Masashi Ōkubo, who is a supporting member of the group.They have released 17 studio albums as of June 2016, and have provided their talents in compilation albums and original soundtracks as well.
