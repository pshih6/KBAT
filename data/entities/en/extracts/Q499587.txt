Fabio Caressa (born on April 18, 1967 in Rome) is an Italian journalist and football commentator, broadcasting for SKY Italia.He began his career in 1986 and in 1991 was chosen to take part in the commentators team for the newly founded Italian pay tv Tele+, founded by the Canal+ Group. In 1998, he started commenting on Sunday evening Serie A matches, making turns with Massimo Marianella. In 2002, he became the main "voice" of SKY Sport and, together with former Inter Milan defender Giuseppe Bergomi, he is now one of the most notorious and appreciated sporting commentators in Italy.
After the World Cup he wrote a book about his experiences during his career and the 2006 World cup, entitled Andiamo a Berlino ("We're going to Berlin"), a reference to Caressa's exclamation at the end of Italy's World Cup semi-final victory against hosts Germany, which ended in a 2â€“0 victory after extra time; just a few seconds after Italy's second goal, scored by Alessandro Del Piero, Caressa shouted the phrase, expressing his joy for Italy's qualification for the World Cup final that would be played in Berlin.
For SKY Sport's coverage of the 2012 Olympics, Caressa also commentated on all swimming events for the first time in his career, with color commentary offered by former World and Olympic champion Massimiliano Rosolino.His wife is Italian TV-news journalist Benedetta Parodi. Together they have two daughters and one son: Matilde (born on 28 September 2002), Eleonora (born on 20 October, 2004) e Diego (born on October 28, 2009).
