Silvio D'Amico (February 3, 1887 in Rome â€“ April 1, 1955 in Rome) was an Italian theatre critic, journalist, and theorist of Italian theater.  Not a Fascist himself, D'Amico was the major theater critic during the ventennio, the twenty years  (1922-1945) of Fascist rule in Italy. He was the first editor of the nine volume Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo (Encyclopedia of Performing Arts), published between 1954 and 1965, that covered theater, music, cinema, and dance.  Most notably, he held an eminent position in theatrical study in Italy, giving his name to the Silvio D'Amico National Academy of Dramatic Art in Rome, Italy's most prestigious drama school.
