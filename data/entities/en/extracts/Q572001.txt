Charles David Keeling (April 20, 1928 â€“ June 20, 2005) was an American scientist whose recording of carbon dioxide at the Mauna Loa Observatory  first alerted the world to the possibility of anthropogenic contribution to the "greenhouse effect" and global warming.  The Keeling Curve measures the progressive buildup of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, in the atmosphere.
