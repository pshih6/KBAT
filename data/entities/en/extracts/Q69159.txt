Wolfgang Staudte (9 October 1906 – 19 January 1984), born Georg Friedrich Staudte, was a German film director, script writer and actor. He was born in Saarbrücken.
His most important work came in the ten years following World War II, in which he worked with the DEFA in East Germany. The main focus of his work was to highlight the limits of German national pride. His work in anti-Nazi films, such as Murderers Among Us (1946), was also a personal working through of his film career under the Nazis (he acted in the anti-Semitic film Jud Süß). 
Following 1956 he worked in West Germany. By the 1970s, his work was no longer considered particularly modern and he moved to television, on shows such as Der Kommissar and Tatort.
