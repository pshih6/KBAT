Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (transl. Will You Marry Me?) is a 2004 Indian romantic comedy film directed by David Dhawan and produced by Sajid Nadiadwala. The film stars Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar and Priyanka Chopra, the second collaboration of Kumar and Chopra after their successful Andaaz (2003). The supporting cast includes Amrish Puri, Kader Khan, Satish Shah and Rajpal Yadav, with several Indian cricket team players in cameo appearances.
Set primarily in Goa, two men (Kumar and Khan) try to win a woman's (Chopra) heart. Wanting to re-invent himself, Dhawan decided to make a film which would deviate from his signature "mass-market" comedies in look and feel, approaching it as a romantic comedy. The screenplay was written by Dhawan's longtime collaborator Anees Bazmee and Rumi Jaffery.
Although the film is set in Goa, it was not shot there. Instead principal photography was done on two detailed sets created by Sharmishta Roy in Film City and Mauritius. Additionally, several scenes and songs were filmed on-location in Mauritius. Mujhse Shaadi Karogi was released on 30 July 2004 to positive reviews, receiving praise for its direction, performances, music, cinematography, art direction, costumes and styling. With a box-office gross of ₹565 million, the film was a major commercial success, becoming the third-highest-grossing Indian film of the year.
Mujhse Shaadi Karogi was nominated for three Filmfare Awards. The film received thirteen nominations at the 2005 IIFA Awards, including Best Film, Best Director (Dhawan), Best Actor (Khan) and Best Actress (Chopra), winning five awards. It received ten Screen Awards nominations, including Best Film.
