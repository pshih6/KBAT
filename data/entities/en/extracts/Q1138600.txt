Craig Jamieson Mack (May 10, 1970 – March 12, 2018) was an American rapper and record producer. He helped build the foundation for Bad Boy Records, one of hip hop’s most influential labels. 
He began rapping as a teenager under the name MC EZ and released one single in 1988, "Just Rhymin'" backed with “Get Retarded,” as part of MC EZ & Troup. Mack then became friends with the hip hop duo EPMD and eventually went on tour with them, doing jobs as a roadie. He helped DJ Scratch assemble and disassemble his turntables at shows. After a few years without forward movement in his recording career, Mack took advantage of an opportunity to rap for Sean Combs, and secured a record deal with Combs’s label, Bad Boy. Mack is best known for his 1994 hit, "Flava in Ya Ear".
