Back to the Future (also known as Back to the Future: The Animated Series) is a French-American animated science-fiction comedy adventure television series for television based on the live-action Back to the Future movie trilogy. The show lasted two seasons, each featuring 13 episodes, and ran on CBS from September 14, 1991 to December 26, 1992. It was rerun until August 14, 1993 on CBS. The network chose not to renew the show for a third season (citing low ratings). It was later rerun on FOX, as a part of the FoxBox block, from March 22 to August 30, 2003. It was the first production of Universal Cartoon Studios.
Although the series takes place after the movies, producer Bob Gale has stated that the animated series and the comic books take place in their own 'what if' and alternate timelines. This show marked the debut television appearance of Bill Nye on a nationally broadcast show.
