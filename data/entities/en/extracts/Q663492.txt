The European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, commonly known as EUROCONTROL, is an international organisation working to achieve safe and seamless air traffic management across Europe. Founded in 1960, EUROCONTROL currently has 41 member states and is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, with local sites in Br√©tigny-sur-Orge, France for its R&D activities, the Institute of Air Navigation Training (IANS) a training centre in Luxembourg, and the Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC). The organisation employs approximately two thousand people and operates with an annual budget in excess of half a billion Euro.Although EUROCONTROL is not an agency of the European Union, the EU has delegated parts of its Single European Sky regulations to EUROCONTROL, making it the central organisation for coordination and planning of air traffic control for all of Europe. The EU itself is a signatory of EUROCONTROL and all EU member states are presently also members of EUROCONTROL. The organisation works with national authorities, air navigation service providers, civil and military airspace users, airports, and other organisations. Its activities involve all gate-to-gate air navigation service operations: strategic and tactical flow management, controller training, regional control of airspace, safety-proofed technologies and procedures, and collection of air navigation charges.
