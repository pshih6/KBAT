West Coast hip hop is a regional genre of hip hop music that encompasses any artists or music that originated in the West Coast region of the United States. West Coast Hip-Hop began to dominate from a radio play and sales standpoint during the early to-mid 1990s with the birth of G-Funk and the emergence of record labels such as Suge Knight and Dr Dre's Death Row Records, Ice Cube's Lench Mob Records and the continued success of Eazy-E's Ruthless Records and others.
