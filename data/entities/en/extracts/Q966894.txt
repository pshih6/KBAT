Jacques Pierre Bainville ([ʒak bɛ̃.vil]; February 9, 1879 – February 9, 1936) was a French historian and journalist. A geopolitical theorist, concerned by Franco-German relations, he was a leading figure in the monarchist Action Française. As fascinated as he was worried by Germany which continuously grew stronger, he intensely advocated against democracy, the French Revolution, internationalism and liberalism.
A plaza is named after him at the heart of the 7th arrondissement of Paris.
