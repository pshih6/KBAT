The Green Liberal Party of Switzerland (German: Grünliberale Partei der Schweiz, glp; French: Parti vert'libéral, pvl), abbreviated to glp, is a centrist green-liberal political party in Switzerland.  Founded in 2007, the party holds sixteen seats in the Federal Assembly as of the October 2019 election.
The party was formed on 19 July 2007 by four cantonal branches of the Green Party. Contesting the election in October 2007 in St. Gallen and Zurich, the party won three seats in the National Council.  A month later, the party won a seat in the Council of States, with Verena Diener representing Zurich. The party has since expanded across Switzerland, and holds seats in thirteen cantonal legislatures in German-speaking Switzerland and the Romandy. The party reached 5.4% at the 2011 federal election, increasing the number of Members of the National Council from 3 to 12, but suffered a setback in 2015 retreating to 7 seats with 4,6% of the national vote.The Green Liberals are a party of the political centre, as opposed to the left Green Party.  They seek to combine liberalism on civil liberties and moderate economic liberalism with environmental sustainability. The party has an autonomous parliamentary group in the Federal Assembly of Switzerland since the 2011 federal election.
