Instituto Superior Técnico (IST, also known coloquially as Técnico, and stylized TÉCNICO LISBOA) is a public school of engineering and technology , part of Universidade de Lisboa. It was founded as an autonomous school in 1911, and integrated in the Universidade Técnica de Lisboa in 1930. IST is the largest school of engineering in Portugal by number of enrolled students, enroled professors, scientific production and patents. 
IST has three campi, all located in the Lisbon metropolitan area: Alameda in Lisbon, Taguspark in Oeiras and Tecnológico e Nuclear Campus in Loures, and consists of ten departments that are responsible for teaching the undergraduate and postgraduate programs. Each department is organized in sections, which group together specific subjects within its scientific area. In addition, the laboratories of the several departments support the teaching and research activities carried out at IST.
It offers 18 undergraduate programmes attended by more than 6,000 students—covering a wide range of areas of knowledge—including not only all the traditional engineering specializations, but also emerging scientific areas such as Biomedical Engineering, Aerospace, and Physics Engineering.
