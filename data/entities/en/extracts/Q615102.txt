Rayko Nikolov Aleksiev (Bulgarian: Райко Николов Алексиев) (March 7, 1893 – November 18, 1944) was a Bulgarian painter, caricaturist, and writer of feuilletons. He established Shturets, a hugely successful satirical newspaper, in 1932.
Known for his uncompromising satire, Aleksiev was especially unloved by  Bulgarian communists due to his famous caricatures of Joseph Stalin. After the Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944 he was, like many other intellectuals, arrested by the newly formed people's militia. While under arrest, he was severely beaten over the course of several days. He died from his wounds. Aleksiev was posthumously sentenced to death by the People's Court.
