Gerhard Schürer (14 April 1921 – 22 December 2010) was a leading politician in East Germany.Between 1963 and 1989 he was a member of the powerful Central Committee of the country's ruling SED (party).   He also served, between 1965 and 1989, as chairman of the State Planning Commission of East Germany's Council of Ministers.It is one mark of his importance that during the 1980s Schürer lived with his family at House 7 in the Wandlitz residential estate.   Wandlitz was the exclusive Berlin enclave where the top party officials lived.   House 7 was a large house, with space to accommodate his (at this stage) second wife and seven children.   A previous occupant had been Chairman Walter Ulbricht.   After reunification, and as the German Democratic Republic receded into history, there were times when he felt able to recall his experiences with greater candour and clarity than others who had known the ruling establishment from the inside.
