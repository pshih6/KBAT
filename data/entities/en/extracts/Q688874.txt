Samael is a Swiss extreme metal band formed in 1987 in Sion, Switzerland.
The current line up of the band include founding members and brothers Vorphalack (Vorph) and Xytraguptor (Xy), guitarist Drop and bassist Zorrac. A few other members have been part of the band throughout the years : Rodolph H. (Keyboards, 1993-1995), Kaos (Guitar 1996-2001), Mas (Bass 1991-2014), and Makro (Guitar 2002-2018).
Samael is known to incorporate metal, industrial, electronic and symphonic music into their sound and mix it with massive beats, martial rhythms, up-tempo or blast beat. One of the key elements that distinguishes Samael from traditional metal bands is the use of a drum machine in studio and live on stage.
