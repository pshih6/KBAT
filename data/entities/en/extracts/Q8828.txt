Mallorca (Catalan: [məˈʎɔɾkə], Spanish: [maˈʎoɾka]) or Majorca (English:  mə-YOR-kə, -⁠JOR-) is the largest island in the Balearic Islands, which are part of Spain and located in the Mediterranean.  The native language, as on the rest of the Balearic Islands, is Catalan, which is co-official with Spanish.
The capital of the island, Palma, is also the capital of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands. The Balearic Islands have been an autonomous region of Spain since 1983. There are two small islands off the coast of Mallorca: Cabrera (southeast of Palma) and Dragonera (west of Palma). The anthem of Mallorca is "La Balanguera".
Like the other Balearic Islands of Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera, the island is an extremely popular holiday destination, particularly for tourists from Germany and the United Kingdom. The international airport, Palma de Mallorca Airport, is one of the busiest in Spain; it was used by 28.0 million passengers in 2017, increasing every year since 2012.The name derives from Classical Latin insula maior, "larger island". Later, in Medieval Latin, this became Maiorica, "the larger one", in comparison to Menorca, "the smaller one".
