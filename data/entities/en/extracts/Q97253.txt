Ludwig Friedrich Barthel (12 June 1898, in Marktbreit â€“ 14 February 1962, in Munich) was a German writer.Barthel served in the First World War and was a student in Munich.  He was later an archivist (German: Archivrat) there.  His poems, for example "Tannenburg: Ruf und Requiem" (Tannenberg: A Call and a Requiem; 1934), and such stories as "Das Leben ruft" (Life Calls; 1935), are influenced by the experience of war, which he made into a cult.  Because of such tendencies, he venerated Nazism, which he celebrated in such extravagant hymns as "Dom aller Deutschen" (The Cathedral of All Germans; 1938).
Barthel also edited the letters of his friend Rudolf Binding (1957).
