Theophil Friedrich Christen (April 1, 1873 in Basel – May 6, 1920 in Genfersee) was a doctor, mathematician, physicist, economist and pioneer of physical medicine, in particular of X-ray radiation.
Zeitschrift für medizinische Physik wrote:
The Swiss mathematician and physician Theophil Christen was one of the first important pioneers in Medical Physics. He structured the previously confused field of physical concepts and definitions for medical applications of X-rays and paved the way for the modern understanding of dosimetry.
In his honor, the Swiss Society for Radiation Biology and Medical Physics established the Theophil-Christen Medal in 2006, first awarded to Jean-François Valley.
