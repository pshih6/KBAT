Never Back Down is a 2008 American martial arts film directed by Jeff Wadlow and starring Sean Faris, Amber Heard, Cam Gigandet, and Djimon Hounsou. The movie was released on March 14, 2008. The film is about a frustrated and conflicted teenager who arrives at a new high school to discover an underground fight club. 
The movie is, in some ways, a recollection of 1984's The Karate Kid; Faris and Heard have the Ralph Macchio and Elizabeth Shue roles, respectively, while Gigandet is in William Zabka's and Hounsou is in Pat Morita's.
An unrated version called the "Extended Beat Down Edition", featuring nudity and more blood, was released on DVD on July 29, 2008.
