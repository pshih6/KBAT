Georges Eugène Sorel (; French: [sɔʁɛl]; 2 November 1847 – 29 August 1922) was a French philosopher and theorist of Sorelianism. His notion of the power of myth in people's lives (in particular, national myth) inspired socialists, anarchists, Marxists, and fascists. It is, together with his defense of violence, the contribution for which he is most often remembered.
