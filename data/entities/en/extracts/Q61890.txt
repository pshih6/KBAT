Marbach am Neckar (population approximately 15,000) is a town on the river Neckar in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The nearest larger cities are Ludwigsburg and Stuttgart (ca. 25 km).
Marbach is known as the birthplace of the classical poet and dramatist, Friedrich Schiller. Although Schiller moved away as a child, he is commemorated in Marbach by the Schiller-Nationalmuseum und Deutsches Literaturarchiv (Schiller National Museum and German Literature Archive), one of the main archives of literature history in the country. In 2006, the Literaturmuseum der Moderne (Museum of Modern Literature) was opened for public just next to the existing museum. The iconic and modern building was planned by British architect David Chipperfield. It displays and archives 20th-century literature. Notable original manuscripts include The Trial by Franz Kafka and Berlin Alexanderplatz by Alfred Döblin.
The town has a picturesque centre with several churches (the older one is from the 16th century) and many historical houses, including the house in which Schiller was born.
Marbach (Neckar) station is on the Backnang–Ludwigsburg railway and it used to be the terminus of line S 4 of the Stuttgart S-Bahn, which was extended to Backnang in 2013.
