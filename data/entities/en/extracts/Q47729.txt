The Democratic Party (Italian: Partito Democratico, PD) is a social-democratic political party in Italy. The party's secretary is Nicola Zingaretti, who was elected in March 2019, while its president is Valentina Cuppi.The PD was founded on 14 October 2007 upon the merger of various centre-left parties which had been part of The Olive Tree list and The Union coalition in the 2006 general election. They notably included the social-democratic Democrats of the Left (DS), successors of the Italian Communist Party and the Democratic Party of the Left which was folded with several social-democratic parties (Labour Federation and Social Christians, among others) in 1998; and the largely Catholic-inspired Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy (DL), merger of the Italian People's Party (heir of the Christian Democracy party's left-wing), The Democrats and Italian Renewal in 2002. Thus, the party's main ideological trends are social democracy and the Italian Christian leftist tradition. The PD has been also influenced by social liberalism which was already present in some of the founding components of the DS and DL and more generally by a Third Way progressivism.
The PD was the second-largest party in Italy in the 2018 general election, the third-largest in the Chamber of Deputies and the fourth-largest in the Senate. Between 2013 and 2018, the Italian government was led by three successive Democratic Prime Ministers, namely Enrico Letta (2013–2014), Matteo Renzi (2014–2016) and Paolo Gentiloni (2016–2018). Since September 2019 the party has been part of the Conte II Cabinet, in a coalition with the Five Star Movement. The party also heads seven regional governments.
