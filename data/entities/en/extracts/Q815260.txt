Born in Kitchener, Ontario, the son of John Honderich Sr. and Rae Honderich, he was a high school drop-out who worked as a cub reporter for the Kitchener-Waterloo Record before heading to Toronto. He was hired at the Star to replace reporters who went to serve in World War II, as Honderich was rejected by the RCAF due to poor eyesight.
