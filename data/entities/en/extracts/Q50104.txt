Deborah Wasserman Schultz (; born September 27, 1966) is an American politician serving as the U.S. Representative from Florida's 23rd congressional district, first elected to Congress in 2004. A member of the Democratic Party, she is a former Chair of the Democratic National Committee.
Wasserman Schultz served in the Florida House of Representatives and the Florida Senate and was a national campaign co-chair for Hillary Clinton's 2008 run for president. Her district covers much of southern Broward County, including a large portion of Fort Lauderdale. It also covers much of northern Miami-Dade County.
Wasserman Schultz was elected chair of the Democratic National Committee in May 2011, replacing Tim Kaine. On July 28, 2016, Wasserman Schultz resigned from her position after WikiLeaks released a collection of stolen emails indicating that Wasserman Schultz and other members of the DNC staff had exercised bias against Bernie Sanders and in favor of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primaries. She was subsequently appointed honorary chair of the Clinton campaign's "50 state program".[73]
