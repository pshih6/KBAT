Mojang AB (from Swedish mojäng [mʊˈjɛŋː], lit. ''gadget'') is a Swedish video game developer and a studio of Xbox Game Studios based in Stockholm. The studio was founded by Markus Persson in 2009 as Mojang Specifications, inheriting the name from a venture of the same name he left two years prior. Mojang began development on the sandbox video game Minecraft in 2009, which would become the best-selling video game of all time and establish a successful multimedia franchise. Mojang Specifications became Mojang in 2010. With a desire to move on from Minecraft, Persson sold Mojang to Xbox Game Studios (then called Microsoft Studios) in 2014, after which the studio developed the spin-offs Minecraft Earth and Minecraft Dungeons. In addition to the Minecraft franchise, Mojang developed the 2014 digital card game Caller's Bane and the 2016 turn-based strategy game Crown and Council, along with various games in Humble Bundle game jams.
As of 2016, Mojang employs 70 people in its Stockholm offices, including the leadership team composed of Jonas Mårtensson (chief executive officer), Vu Bui (chief operating officer), Karin Severinson (chief financial officer), and Rikard Herlitz (chief technology officer).
