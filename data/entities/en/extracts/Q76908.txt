Maximilian, Margrave of Baden (Maximilian Alexander Friedrich Wilhelm; 10 July 1867 â€“ 6 November 1929), also known as Max von Baden, was a German prince and politician. He was heir presumptive to the throne of the Grand Duchy of Baden, and in October and November 1918 briefly served as Chancellor of the German Empire. He sued for peace on Germany's behalf at the end of World War I based on U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, which included immediately transforming the government into a parliamentary system, by handing over the title of chancellor to SPD Chairman Friedrich Ebert and unilaterally proclaiming the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II.  Both events took place on 9 November 1918, the beginning of the Weimar Republic.
