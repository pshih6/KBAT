Arcadi Aleksandrovich Gaydamak (Hebrew: ארקדי אלכסנדרוביץ' גאידמק; Russian: Аркадий Александрович Гайдамак; born 8 April 1952 in Moscow, USSR) is a Russian-born French-Israeli businessman, philanthropist, and President of the Congress of Jewish Religious Communities and Organizations of Russia (KEROOR). He emigrated to Israel at the age of 20 and lived on a kibbutz, then moved to France and opened a translation bureau.
In the 1990s he was awarded the French Ordre national du Mérite and the Ordre du Mérite agricole for actions taken to rescue personnel in the War in Bosnia. In the AngolaGate scandal, he was convicted of failure to declare income. On 24 November 2015, he started serving a prison sentence at Fresnes prison in France for that tax issue.
In the early 21st century, Gaydamak returned to Israel, where he founded Social Justice, a movement that became a political party. He ran for mayor of Jerusalem but did not win. He bought Hapoel Jerusalem, a professional basketball club. He also bought two newspapers, one in France and one in Russia. He directed the latter to take a pro-government/Vladimir Putin editorial stance. In Israel he has been a generous philanthropist.
