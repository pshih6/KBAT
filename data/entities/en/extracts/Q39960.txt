Iron Eagle II (also titled Iron Eagle II: The Battle Beyond the Flag) is a 1988 military action film directed by Sidney J. Furie and written by Furie and Kevin Alyn Elders. It is the first sequel to the 1986 film Iron Eagle, with Louis Gossett, Jr. reprising his role as Charles "Chappy" Sinclair, alongside newcomers Mark Humphrey, Stuart Margolin, Maury Chaykin, Alan Scarfe, Colm Feore, and Clark Johnson. An uncredited Jason Gedrick also returns as ace pilot Doug Masters in the film's opening scene.
The film's story is loosely based on Operation Opera, a surprise airstrike carried out by the Israeli Air Force on a nuclear reactor near Baghdad, Iraq on June 7, 1981.
Like its predecessor, Iron Eagle II received negative reviews. It also did not fare well at the box-office, with earnings of $10,497,324. Despite this, it was nominated for three Genie Awards (Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Sound Editing, and Best Overall Sound).
