Ta Ra Rum Pum  is a 2007 Indian sports-drama film. The film stars Saif Ali Khan, Rani Mukerji, Angelina Idani, Ali Haji and Javed Jaffrey. This is the second time the lead pair worked together after the success of their last film, Hum Tum (2004). It was directed by Siddharth Anand, who directed 2005's Salaam Namaste (Also starring Khan), and also wrote Hum Tum. The film was a hit at the box office in India and was one of the highest-grossing films of 2007. Ta Ra Rum Pum marks the final commercial success in a romance film of Rani Mukerji, who was the highest-paid actress in Bollywood during the 2000s. It is inspired by Days of Thunder (1990), while film critic Rajeev Masand says that "the plotâ€™s been borrowed generously from such films as Cinderella Man, In America and Life Is Beautiful."
