Catherine Elizabeth Pierson (born April 27, 1948) is an American singer, lyricist, and one of the singers and founding members of the B-52's. A multi-instrumentalist, she plays guitar, bass and various keyboard instruments. In the B-52s, she has performed alongside Cindy Wilson, Fred Schneider, Ricky Wilson, and Keith Strickland. In the early years, as well as a vocalist, Pierson was also the main keyboard player and was notable for performing on a keyboard bass during many live shows and many of the band's recordings, taking on a role usually filled by a bass guitar player which differentiated the band from their contemporaries. This along with Pierson's distinctive wide ranging singing voice remain trademarks of the B-52's unique sound. Pierson has also collaborated with many other artists including The Ramones, Iggy Pop and R.E.M.
In February 2015, Pierson released her first solo album, Guitars and Microphones, featuring material co-written by Sia Furler. She later released the non-album single "Better Not Sting the Bee," and on April 15, 2016, she released a cover of "Venus" as a single.
