Josef Bucher (born 19 August 1965 in Friesach) is an Austrian politician and former leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ) as well as former Member of Parliament for the party. Divorced with two children, Bucher is a hotel owner.After the death of BZÖ chairman Jörg Haider, Bucher was elected Klubobmann, chairman of the party's parliamentary grouping on 22 October 2008. 
Initially, Stefan Petzner, Haider's designated successor as party chairman, was expected to be elected to that post as well. Petzner had to pass the leadership over to former vice-chairman Herbert Scheiber.
