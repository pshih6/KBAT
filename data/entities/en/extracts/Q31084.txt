Jever (German pronunciation: [ˈjeːfɐ]; the pronunciation [ˈjeːvɐ] is often heard from non-locals) is the capital of the district of Friesland in Lower Saxony, Germany. The name Jever is usually associated with a major brand of beer which is produced there. The city is also a popular holiday resort. Jever was granted city status in 1536. Unofficially Jever is sometimes referred to as Marienstadt (Maria city) in reference to Maria of Jever, the last independent ruler of the city.  The inhabitants of Jever are named Jeveraner.
