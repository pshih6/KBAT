Sir Philip Nigel Ross Green (born 15 March 1952) is a British billionaire businessman, and the chairman of Arcadia Group, a retail company that includes Topshop, Topman, Wallis, Evans, Burton, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins and Outfit. The defunct BHS chain was also part of the group.
Green has been involved in a number of controversies during his career, including his actions prior to the demise of BHS. In October 2016, the House of Commons approved a measure to ask the Honours Forfeiture Committee to strip Green of his knighthood for his role in the downfall of BHS. This decision was not legally binding and his knighthood was not revoked, although there were later calls to revoke it if allegations of sexual harassment, bullying and racism revealed in October 2018 are proved.
