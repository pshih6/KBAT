Stanley also designed the band's trademark skull logo.Stanley was the first known private individual to manufacture mass quantities of LSD. By his own account, between 1965 and 1967, Stanley produced no less than 500 grams of LSD, amounting to a little more than five million doses.He died in a car accident in Australia (where he had taken citizenship in 1996) on March 12, 2011.
