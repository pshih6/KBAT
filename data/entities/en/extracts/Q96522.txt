Salman Schocken or Shlomo Zalman Schocken (Hebrew: שלמה זלמן שוקן‎) (October 30, 1877 –  August 6, 1959) was a German Jewish publisher, and co-founder of the large Kaufhaus Schocken chain of department stores in Germany. Stripped of his citizenship and forced to sell his company by the German government, he immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1934, where he purchased the newspaper Haaretz (still majority-owned by his family). In 1940, Schocken moved to the United States, where he founded Schocken Books.
