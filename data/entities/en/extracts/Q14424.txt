Nagykanizsa (Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈnɒckɒniʒɒ], or just Kanizsa; Croatian: Velika Kaniža/Velika Kanjiža, or just Kaniža/Kanjiža; German: Großkirchen, Groß-Kanizsa; Italian: Canissa; Slovene: Velika Kaniža; Turkish: Kanije) is a medium-sized city in Zala County in southwestern Hungary.
It lies not far from Lake Balaton at the meeting point of five routes. For centuries the town has been a connecting link. Goods from Slavonia were transported to Graz via Nagykanizsa, and the town played an important role in the trade from the Adriatic Sea to the Alpine region, Vienna, and Budapest.
