Slayers Special (スレイヤーズすぺしゃる, Sureiyāzu supesharu), also known as Slayers: Dragon Slave, Slayers: Explosion Array and Slayers: The Book of Spells in North America, is a series of three comic fantasy themed OVA self-conclusive episodes adapted from the Slayers Special series of light-novels by Hajime Kanzaka, serving as a part of the prequel to the main Slayers saga. The three episodes were all directed by Hiroshi Watanabe and originally released separately in Japan in 1996-1997. Both Special and the second OVA series, 1998's Slayers Excellent, were directed by Watanabe and share the same soundtrack (Slayers The Motion Picture "S"), although each series had their own production committees and has its own opening and ending themes.
In the first episode, "The Scary Chimera Plan" (恐怖のリメラ計画, Kyōfu no rimera keikaku),  Lina Inverse refuses to take place in a chimera experiment so the wizard scientist makes clones to force Lina; however, he clones Naga the Serpent instead, which leads to his downfall. In the second episode, "Jeffrey's Knighthood" (ジェフリー君の騎士道, Jefurī-kun no kishidō), Lina and Naga are hired to train a pathetic yet overconfident young man by his mother, who follows him around and beats up anyone who talks negatively about her son. In the third episode, "Mirror, Mirror" (鏡よ鏡, Kagami yo, kagami), Lina and Naga are hired to find and destroy a magic mirror that makes clones of whomever is reflected; the only difference is the clones have the opposite personality of the original, as Lina and Naga personally find out.
