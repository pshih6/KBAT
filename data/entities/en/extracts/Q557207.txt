Tomoaki Ishizuka (Japanese: 石塚 智昭, Hepburn: Ishizuka Tomoaki, born November 4, 1965 in Chiba), known exclusively by his stage name Pata, is a Japanese musician. He is best known as the rhythm guitarist for the rock band X Japan. He joined the band in 1987, stayed with them until their dissolution in 1997 and rejoined when the band started a comeback in 2007.
A year after their breakup, he formed the short-lived duo P.A.F. with singer NoB and created the band Dope HEADz with X Japan bassist Heath and former Spread Beaver percussionist/programmer I.N.A. in 2000. Right after they ceased activity, Pata formed the instrumental band Ra:IN in 2002, which still tours extensively to this day.
His stage name is taken from the manga Patalliro!, as he was said to resemble the title character.
