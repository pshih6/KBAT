Brad Barron Renfro (July 25, 1982 â€“ January 15, 2008) was an American actor. Renfro made his film debut at the age of 11 with a starring role in The Client (1994), and went on to appear in 21 feature films. 
Prior to being cast in The Client, Renfro had no acting background and was living with his grandmother in a trailer park. Director Joel Schumacher wanted to cast a "tough kid" who had the necessary life experience to understand the character he would portray. Renfro soon attracted a large fanbase as he continued to star in movies like Tom and Huck and Sleepers. Beginning in the late 1990s, Renfro had difficulties in his private life, including a series of arrests and stints in drug treatment. He died from an overdose of heroin and morphine at the age of 25.
