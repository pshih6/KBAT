Antonie Pfülf, generally known in Germany as Toni Pfülf, (1877–1933) was a German politician who represented the Social Democratic Party, SPD. A supporter of equal rights for women, she was an elected member of the Reichstag from 1920 to 1933. After joining her SPD colleagues in fruitlessly opposing the Enabling Act, which established rule by the Nazi regime in March 1933, she was driven to despair and committed suicide the following June.
