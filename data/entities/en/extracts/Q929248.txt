In the Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu cabinet, he was Agriculture Minister from October 2007 to December 2008. In November 2009, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso nominated him to be the next Agriculture Commissioner, a post he assumed in February 2010 and held until his term expired in November 2014. In November 2015, President Klaus Iohannis named him Prime Minister, and Cioloș assumed office after receiving approval from Parliament. He remained until after the 2016 parliamentary election, which was lost by the parties that called for Cioloș to continue his term. Cioloș is the founder and current leader of the Freedom, Unity and Solidarity Party. In May 2019, he was elected a Member of the European Parliament, subsequently becoming leader of the new Renew Europe political group.
