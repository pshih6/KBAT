Soleilmoon Recordings is an American record label that began in 1987 as a cassette label, operating from the back of a record shop called the Ooze in Portland, Oregon, US.
The first releases were by Smegma, Muslimgauze, Coil, and Nocturnal Emissions. In 1991 the shop was sold and Soleilmoon became a full-time label.
