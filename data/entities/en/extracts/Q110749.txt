Will Tremper (19 September 1928 â€“ 14 December 1998) was a German journalist and filmmaker (writer, director, producer). He wrote twelve screenplays between 1956 and 1988. The young and then unknown actor Horst Buchholz starred in his first three films. With only a handful of films to his credit, he established himself quickly as the German answer to the directors of the Nouvelle Vague in France.
