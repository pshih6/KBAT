He worked for Stabilimenti Farina in Turin before joining Pininfarina in 1930.
In 1944 (with Giorgio Alberti), Boano bought the Carrozzeria Ghia in Torino when their friend Giacinto Ghia died.

They  took over some of Ferrari 250 GT production from Pininfarina. After only three years, Boano closed, and his son-in-law Ezio Ellena took over the 250 production in his Carrozzeria Ellena (1957–1966).Starting in 1957, Boano worked under Dante Giacosa for Fiat in their Turin styling department, creating the Fiat 600 and the square style of Simca 1000.  His son Gian Paolo Boano (1930–) succeeded him in 1959, as leader of the Centro Stile, Fiats styling department.Mario retired from Fiat in 1966. Gian Paolo remained with Fiat until 1988. Mario Boano died in 1989.
