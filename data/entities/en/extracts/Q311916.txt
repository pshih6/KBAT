Uday Saddam Hussein al-Tikriti (Arabic: عدي صدام حسين التكريتي‎; c. 1964 - 22 July 2003) was the eldest child of Saddam Hussein by his first wife, Sajida Talfah, and the brother of Qusay Hussein. Uday was seen for several years as the likely successor to his father, but lost the place as heir apparent to Qusay due to injuries he sustained in an assassination attempt. 
Witness allegations have suggested that Uday was guilty of rape, murder, and torture, including the arrest and torture of Iraqi Olympic athletes and members of the national football team whenever they lost a match.Following the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, he was killed alongside his brother Qusay and nephew Mustapha by an American task force after a prolonged gunfight in Mosul.
