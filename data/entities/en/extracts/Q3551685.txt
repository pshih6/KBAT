The University of Trinity College, known simply as Trinity College, is a college federated to the University of Toronto, founded in 1851 by Bishop John Strachan. Trinity College was originally intended by the founder Strachan as a college of strong Anglican alignment, after the University of Toronto severed its ties with the Church of England. In 1904, Trinity joined the university as a member of its collegiate federation.
Trinity College consists of a secular undergraduate section and a postgraduate divinity school that is part of the Toronto School of Theology. Through its diploma granting authority in the field of Divinity, Trinity maintains official university status. Trinity hosts three of the University of Toronto Faculty of Arts and Sciences undergraduate programs: international relations; ethics, society and law; and immunology.Among the University of Toronto Colleges, Trinity stands out for its active student life and trappings of English heritage; the College hosts weekly formal dinners, maintains the tradition of academic gowns, manages its student government through direct democracy, and hosts a litany of clubs and societies.
