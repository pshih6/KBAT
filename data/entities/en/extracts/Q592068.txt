The Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) was the largest communist party in Great Britain between 1920 and 1991, although it never became a mass party like those in France and Italy. Founded in 1920 by the merger of several smaller Marxist parties, the party gained the support of many socialist organisations and workers' committees during the period after World War I and the Russian October Revolution. Many miners joined the party through 1926 and 1927 after the General Strike of 1926. In 1945, two of the party's MPs won seats in the general election. From 1945 to 1956, the party was at the height of its influence. It experienced its greatest loss of membership after the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the party's Eurocommunist leadership decided to disband the party, establishing the Democratic Left think tank. The anti-Eurocommunist faction had launched the Communist Party of Britain in 1988.
