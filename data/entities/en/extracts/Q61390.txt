Müller was the son of a saddler in Heidelberg. Along with Heinrich Boie and Heinrich Christian Macklot, he was sent by Coenraad Jacob Temminck to collect specimens in the East Indies. Here, he worked as an assistant for the Natuurkundige Commissie (Commission for Natural Sciences), an organization that he eventually became a member of.Müller arrived in Batavia in 1826, then journeyed to New Guinea and Timor in 1828 aboard the Triton. Beginning in October 1828, he remained at the port city of Kupang, penetrating the interior of Timor during the following year. In 1831 he was stationed in Java, and later explored western Sumatra from 1833 to 1835.
