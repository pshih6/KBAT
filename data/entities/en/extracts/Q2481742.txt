Pierre-Charles-Alexandre Louis (14 April 1787 â€“ 22 August 1872) was a French physician, clinician and pathologist known for his studies on tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and pneumonia, but Louis's greatest contribution to medicine was the development of the "numerical method", forerunner to epidemiology and the modern clinical trial, paving the path for evidence-based medicine.
