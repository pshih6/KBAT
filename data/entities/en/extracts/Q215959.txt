John Stith Pemberton (July 8, 1831 â€“ August 16, 1888) was an American biochemist and American Civil War veteran who is best known as the inventor of Coca-Cola. In May 1886, he developed an early version of a beverage that would later become world-famous as Coca-Cola, but sold his rights to the drink shortly before his death.
