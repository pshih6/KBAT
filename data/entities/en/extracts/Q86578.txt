Catharina Regina von Greiffenberg (7 September 1633, Viehdorf â€” 10 April 1694, Nuremberg) was an Austrian poet of the Baroque era. Greiffenberg is one of the most significant German-language female writers of the early current time frame. Her work is regularly profoundly close to home, as often as possible communicated as an inward monolog. [1]
