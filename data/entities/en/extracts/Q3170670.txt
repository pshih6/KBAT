Jean Beausire (February 26, 1651 - March 20, 1743), was an architect, engineer and fountain-maker and the chief of public works in Paris for King Louis XIV of France and King Louis XV of France between 1684 and 1740,  and was the architect of all the public fountains constructed in Paris that period.  Several of his fountains still exist and continue to work.  Three streets in the 4th arrondissement of Paris today carry his name:  Rue Jean-Beausire, Impasse Jean-Beausire, and Passage Jean-Beausire.
