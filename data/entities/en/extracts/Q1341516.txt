Westminster School is a historic public school in London, England, located within the precincts of Westminster Abbey and immediately beside the Palace of Westminster (Houses of Parliament). Westminster's origins can be traced to the charity school established by the Benedictine monks of Westminster Abbey before the Norman Conquest in 1066, documented by the Croyland Chronicle and one of the Abbey's treasures, a charter of King Offa.  Its continuous existence is certain from the early fourteenth century.  Boys are admitted to Under School at the age of seven and by examination to the senior school at the age of thirteen; girls are admitted to the Sixth Form at the age of sixteen. The school has around 750 pupils; around a quarter are boarders, who mostly go home at weekends after Saturday morning school.The school motto, Dat Deus Incrementum, is taken from 1 Corinthians 3:6: "I planted the seed and Apollos watered it, but God made it grow"  Westminster is one of the original nine great English Public Schools examined by the Clarendon Commission of 1861. and reformed by the Public Schools Acts.
