William Cary Renfrow (March 15, 1845 â€“ January 31, 1922) was a native of North Carolina who lived there until he enlisted in the Confederate Army at the age of 17. After being mustered out at the end of the American Civil War, he moved to Arkansas. He participated in the Land Run of 1889 in what would become Oklahoma Territory, and settled in Norman where he became a banker and an American businessman. President Grover Cleveland appointed him to serve as the 3rd Governor of Oklahoma Territory from 1893 to 1897. After completing his term of office, he moved to Miami, Oklahoma, where he became active in lead and zinc mining business. He followed this activity by entering the oil and gas business in Texas, which proved quite profitable. He died in Arkansas in 1922 while traveling to see his brother.
