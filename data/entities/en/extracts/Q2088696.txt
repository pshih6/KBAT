Suzuka (Japanese: 涼風) is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Kouji Seo. The series is a character-driven romance story that uses the athletics of track and field as a subplot. The story primarily follows the life of the teenager Yamato Akitsuki, who moved to Tokyo to change himself, and his main love interest Suzuka Asahina, a talented and highly scouted high jumper who lives in Yamato's aunt's dormitory and attends his new high school.
Suzuka was serialized in the Japanese magazine Weekly Shōnen Magazine published by Kodansha. It was adapted into a twenty-six episode anime series and aired on TV Tokyo in Japan between 6 July 2005 and 28 December 2005. Both versions of the series have been licensed for release in North America. The manga has been licensed for publication in North America by Del Rey Manga under their mature line; it published the first 15 volumes, before it folded and transferred its publication rights to Kodansha USA. The anime series has been licensed and released by FUNimation Entertainment. Two light novels written by Ayuna Fujisaki based on the series have also been released.  A related series, Kimi no Iru Machi (A Town Where You Live), ran in Weekly Shōnen Magazine from 2008 until 2014, and a sequel, Fuuka, has been running in the same magazine since 2014 until 2018.
