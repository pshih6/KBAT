Screamers is a 2006 documentary film directed by Carla Garapedian, conceived by Peter McAlevey and Garapedian and produced by McAlevey. The film explores why genocides have occurred in modern day history and features talks from Serj Tankian, lead vocalist of the American alternative metal band System of a Down, whose grandfather is an Armenian Genocide survivor, as well as from human-rights activist, journalist, and professor, Samantha Power, as well as various other people involved with genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. Screamers also examines genocide denial in current-day Turkey, and the neutral trend that the United States generally holds towards genocide.In January 2007, Journalist Hrant Dink was assassinated by a 17-year-old Turkish nationalist in Istanbul shortly after the premiere of Screamers, in which he was interviewed about Turkish denial of the Armenian Genocide of 1915 and the case against him under article 301.
Screamers is now shown in Armenian Youth organizations to explain and clarify the Armenian Genocide, and raise awareness. Also, it is used to educate Armenians and others about the genocide.
