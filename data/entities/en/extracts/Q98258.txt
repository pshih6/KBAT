He studied medicine at the University of Leipzig, where in 1779 he obtained his habilitation. In 1780/81 he took a study trip to southern Germany, Switzerland, France, the Netherlands and England. Afterwards in Leipzig, he became an associate professor of medicine (1782) and natural history (1787). In 1796 he was named a full professor of pathology, and he later attained professorships in therapy and materia medica (from 1812) and surgery (from 1820).
