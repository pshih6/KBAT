Riblja Čorba (Serbian Cyrillic: Рибља Чорба, pronounced [rîbʎaː t͡ʃɔ̌ːrba]; translation: litr. Fish Stew) is a Serbian and Yugoslav rock band from Belgrade. The band was one of the most popular and most influential acts of the Yugoslav rock scene.
Riblja Čorba was formed in 1978 by vocalist Bora Đorđević, guitarist Rajko Kojić, bass guitarist Miša Aleksić and drummer Vicko Milatović. Their debut release, the single "Lutka sa naslovne strane" (1978), saw huge success and launched them to fame. They were soon joined by guitarist Momčilo Bajagić "Bajaga", the new lineup releasing the album Kost u grlu (1979), which was, largely due to Đorđević's social-related lyrics, a huge commercial and critical success. Their following releases, Pokvarena mašta i prljave strasti (1981), Mrtva priroda (1981) and Buvlja pijaca (1982) launched them to the top of the Yugoslav rock scene; Đorđević's provocative social- and political-related lyrics were praised by the critics and often caused media scandals. In the mid 1980s, the band saw a slight decline in popularity, but made a triumphant comeback with the album Istina (1985), recorded with new guitar duo, Vidoja "Džindžer" Božinović and Nikola Čuturilo. Until the end of the decade and breakup of Yugoslavia, the band managed to sustain their popularity, but after the beginning of Yugoslav wars it heavily declined in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, due to Đorđević's support for Serbian nationalism. However, Đorđević also opposed the regime of Slobodan Milošević, demonstrating his attitude on the albums Riblja Čorba recorded during the 1990s. Since the beginning of the 2000s, the band manages to remain one of the top acts of the Serbian rock scene, although the albums they released during the 2000s and 2010s saw little critical success.
