Cool World is a 1992 American live-action/animated fantasy-comedy film directed by Ralph Bakshi, and starring Kim Basinger, Gabriel Byrne and Brad Pitt. It tells the story of a cartoonist who finds himself in the animated world he thinks he created, where he is seduced by one of the characters, a comic strip vamp who wants to be real. 
Cool World marked Bakshi's return to feature films after nine years. The film was originally pitched as a live-action/animated horror film about an underground cartoonist who fathers an illegitimate half-real/half-cartoon daughter, who hates herself for what she is and tries to kill her parents. During production, Bakshi's original screenplay was rewritten by Frank Mancuso Jr. in collaboration with Michael Grais and Mark Victor to change it from an R rated film to a PG-13 per studio directive. Reviews praised the film's visuals, soundtrack and mostly the animation but criticized the story and characters, as well as the combination of live-action and animation, which some critics felt was unconvincing. The film eventually grossed only half its production budget.
