Wolfgang Borchert (German: [ˈbɔɐ̯çɐt]; 20 May 1921 – 20 November 1947) was a German author and playwright whose work was strongly influenced by his experience of dictatorship and his service in the Wehrmacht during the Second World War. His work is among the best-known examples of the Trümmerliteratur movement in post-World War II Germany. His most famous work is the drama "Draußen vor der Tür (The Man Outside)", which he wrote soon after the end of World War II. His works are known not to make compromises on the issues of humanity and humanism. He is one of the most popular authors of the German postwar period; his work continues to be studied regularly in German schools.
