Devin Gerald Nunes (; born October 1, 1973) is an American Republican politician and former dairy farmer serving as the U.S. Representative for California's 22nd congressional district since 2003. He was Chair of the House Intelligence Committee from 2015 to 2019 and a member of President Trump's transition team. Nunes's district, numbered as the 21st from 2003 to 2013 and as the 22nd after redistricting, is in the San Joaquin Valley and includes most of western Tulare County and much of eastern Fresno County.
In March 2017 the U.S. House intelligence committee, which Nunes chaired at the time, launched an investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. On April 6, 2017, he temporarily stepped aside from leading that investigation while the Office of Congressional Ethics investigated allegations (which Nunes denied) that he had improperly disclosed classified information to the public. In December 2017 the Republican-majority U.S. House Committee on Ethics closed its investigation without taking any action against Nunes.In February 2018, Nunes publicly released the Nunes memo, a four-page memorandum alleging an FBI conspiracy against Donald Trump. Nunes subsequently began an investigation of the FBI and the Justice Department for allegedly abusing their powers in an attempt to hurt Trump. Nunes's attacks on the FBI and the investigation by independent counsel Robert Mueller have created concerns among Democrats and some Republicans about Republicans' efforts to halt the investigation and to protect Trump from any allegations against him.
