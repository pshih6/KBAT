Solaris (Russian: Солярис, tr. Solyaris) is a 1972 Soviet science fiction art film based on Stanisław Lem's novel of the same name published in 1961. The film was co-written and directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, and stars Donatas Banionis and Natalya Bondarchuk. The electronic music score was performed by Eduard Artemyev; a composition by J.S. Bach is also employed. 
The plot centers on a space station orbiting the fictional planet Solaris, where a scientific mission has stalled because the skeleton crew of three scientists have fallen into emotional crises. Psychologist Kris Kelvin (Banionis) travels to the station in order to evaluate the situation, only to encounter the same mysterious phenomena as the others. The film was Tarkovsky's attempt to bring a new emotional depth to science fiction films; he viewed most western works in the genre as shallow due to their focus on technological invention.Solaris won the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury and the FIPRESCI prize at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Palme d'Or. It is often cited as one of the greatest science fiction films in the history of cinema. Some of the ideas Tarkovsky expresses in this film are further developed in his Stalker (1979).
