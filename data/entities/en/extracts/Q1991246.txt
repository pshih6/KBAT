Henry Shaw (July 24, 1800 in Sheffield, England â€“ August 25, 1889 in St. Louis, Missouri) was a major businessman and entrepreneur in St. Louis when it was a gateway city to the West. His businesses supplied residents, pioneers and others. Having made his fortune, he was able to retire at age 40, pursue his interest in botany, and used much of his fortune in philanthropy. He is best known as the founder of the Missouri Botanical Garden, but he also donated the land to the city for Tower Grove Park and oversaw its development. He donated funds to several other city institutions as well.
