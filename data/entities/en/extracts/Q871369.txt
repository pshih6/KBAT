Mozarteum University Salzburg, or officially in German Universität Mozarteum Salzburg, is one of three affiliated but separate entities under the “Mozarteum” moniker in that Austrian city. (The International Mozarteum Foundation and the Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg are the other two.) It specializes in music and the dramatic arts and, like its affiliates, was established in honour of Salzburg-born musician Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
