Knopper is married to Adriane Knopper, who has a visual impairment. She has been assisting Knopper with a version of Knoppix for blind and visually impaired people, released in the third quarter of 2007 as a Live CD. Her name has been given to the distribution: Adriane Knoppix.Adriane is more of a desktop or "Non-graphical-userinterface" for blind computer beginners than a "distribution". It will work on any Linux distribution that has a screenreader (Preferably SBL (Screenreader for Blind Linux Users)) and some text-based tools for internet access and normal work.
