Lyon–Saint Exupéry Airport (French: Aéroport de Lyon-Saint Exupéry), formerly known as Lyon Satolas Airport (IATA: LYS, ICAO: LFLL), is the international airport of Lyon, the third-biggest city in France and an important transport facility for the entire Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region. It lies in Colombier-Saugnieu, 11 nautical miles (20 km; 13 mi) southeast of Lyon's city centre. The airport is directly linked to Lyon-Part-Dieu Business District thanks to the Rhônexpress shuttle's 30-minute ride.
