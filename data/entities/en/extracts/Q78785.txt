Johann Adam Bernhard Ritter von Bartsch (17 August 1757 â€“ 21 August 1821) was an Austrian scholar and artist. His catalogue of old master prints is the foundation of the art history of printmaking, and he was himself a printmaker in engraving and etching.
Bartsch was born and died in Vienna.  He joined the staff of the Royal Court Library in Vienna in 1777, after studying engraving at the Vienna Kupferstecheracademie, and became Head curator of the print collection in 1791. He was also an advisor to Duke Albert of Saxe-Teschen, who founded the collection of the Albertina, Vienna, then as now the world's finest collection of old master prints.  In the twentieth century the two collections were merged in the Albertina.
