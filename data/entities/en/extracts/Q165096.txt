Princess MÃ¤rtha Louise of Norway (born 22 September 1971) is a Norwegian self-described clairvoyant and the only daughter and elder child of King Harald V and Queen Sonja. She was married to the late writer and visual artist Ari Behn from 2002 to 2017.
She is fourth in the line of succession to the Norwegian throne, after her brother Haakon, and his children, but is not a member of the royal house. Like her aunts Ragnhild and Astrid, she had no inheritance rights to the Norwegian throne at the time of her birth due to Norway's agnatic primogeniture succession. This only changed in 1990, when the Norwegian parliament adopted male-preference primogeniture succession for those born before 1990, which made her third in line at the time, after her younger brother. She was however 30th in the line of succession to the British throne already at the time of her birth.She is active as a full-time private businesswoman and alternative therapist, with few official public engagements. From 2007 to 2018 she led her own alternative therapy center, commonly known in Norway as the "angel school" (Norwegian: engleskolen), which provided training in clairvoyance and communication with angels and communication with the dead. In May 2019 she publicly announced her romantic relationship and professional collaboration with Durek Verrett, a self-described American shaman.As part of her withdrawal into private professional life she lost the style "Royal Highness" in 2002, and she holds no style in Norway; the lower style "Highness" is occasionally used informally abroad, but does not officially exist and is not used in Norway. She has often faced criticism in Norway for her claims of being clairvoyant and for exploiting her constitutional title as princess commercially; in 2019 the royal court announced that she will no longer use the title princess in her business activities as a clairvoyant.
