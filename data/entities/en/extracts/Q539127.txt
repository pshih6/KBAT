Corey Robin (born 1967) is an American political theorist, journalist and professor of political science at Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.  He has written books on the role of fear in political life, tracing its presence from Aristotle through the war on terror, and on the nature of conservatism in the modern world, from Edmund Burke to Donald Trump. Most recently, he is the author of a revisionist study of Justice Clarence Thomas that argues that the mainspring of Thomas's jurisprudence is a combination of black nationalism and black conservatism.
Although he is on the left, Robin is unique among political theorists in focusing his attention on what he believes are the darker arts of politics on the right: counterrevolution, political repression and intimidation, revanchism and reaction. He has brought the issues outside academic circles, writing frequently for mainstream outlets and venues.
