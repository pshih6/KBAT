Baron Jacob Adolphe Reinach (17 April 1840 – 19 November 1892), known as Jacques de Reinach was a French banker of Jewish German origin, involved in many major financial deals before being brought down by the Panama scandals. He was the son of Clementine Oppenheim (1822–1899) and her husband Adolphe de Reinach (1814–1879), Belgian consul in Frankfurt, ennobled in Italy in 1866 and then confirmed as a noble by William I of Germany.
