Comedy-drama or dramedy (a portmanteau of drama and comedy), is a genre of dramatic works (including film, television, and theatre) in which plot elements are a combination of comedy and drama. It is a subgenre of contemporary tragicomedy. Comedy-drama is especially found in television programs and is considered a "hybrid genre".
