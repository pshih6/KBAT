Eva Herman (born Eva Feldker 9 November 1958 in Emden, Lower Saxony) is a German author and former television presenter. She worked as a news presenter on the nationwide Tagesschau news programme from 1989 to 2006 and also presented various other television programmes for the Norddeutscher Rundfunk until 2007. In 2003, an opinion poll by TNS Emnid declared Herman to be "Germany's favourite presenter".Starting in 2006, Herman authored multiple books that were critical of feminism and advocated for traditional female gender roles. Her books were met with widespread criticism and media scrutiny. In 2007, Herman was dismissed from her position as a news anchor at German national broadcaster ARD, after positively reviewing the family policies and gender roles of Nazi Germany.
