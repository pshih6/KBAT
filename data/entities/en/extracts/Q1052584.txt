The Rally for the Republic (French: Rassemblement pour la République French pronunciation: ​[ʁa.sɑ̃.blə.mɑ̃.puʁ.la.ʁe.pyˈblik]; RPR French pronunciation: ​[ɛr.peˈɛr]), was a Gaullist and conservative political party in France. Originating from the Union of Democrats for the Republic (UDR), it was founded by Jacques Chirac in 1976 and presented itself as the heir of Gaullist politics. On 21 September 2002, the RPR was merged into the Union for the Presidential Majority, later renamed the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP).
