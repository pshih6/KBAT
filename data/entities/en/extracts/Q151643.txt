Vengo is a 2000 Spanish-French-German-Japanese film by Tony Gatlif. It is the passionate story of a blood feud among Spanish Gypsies that centers on Caco, a proud man who must fight for his family's honor and safety. An ode to the artistry and magic of flamenco dancing and music, Vengo is a drama set against the compelling backdrop of two Andalusia gypsy families locked in an age-old struggle for power. The dramatic film also features a performance by the famed Spanish flamenco singer "La Caita" (Maria del Carmen Salazar) and many other performers. It was the closing film at the 57th (2000) Venice International Film Festival.
