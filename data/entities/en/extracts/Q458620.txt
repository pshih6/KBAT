The Peace Corps is a volunteer program run by the United States government. Its official mission is to provide social and economic development abroad through technical assistance, while promoting mutual understanding between Americans and populations served. The program was established by Executive Order 10924, issued by President John F. Kennedy on March 1961 and authorized by Congress on September 21, 1962 with passage of the Peace Corps Act (Pub.L. 87â€“293).
Peace Corps Volunteers are American citizens, typically with a college degree, who work abroad for a period of two years after three months of training. Volunteers work with governments, schools, non-profit organizations, non-government organizations, and entrepreneurs in education, youth development, community health, business, information technology, agriculture, and the environment. After 24 months of service, volunteers can request an extension of service.Since its inception, more than 235,000 Americans have joined the Peace Corps and served in 141 countries. In 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic all volunteers were evacuated from all posts. There are currently no volunteers serving at this time.
