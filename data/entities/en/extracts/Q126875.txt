Martin Kessel (14 April 1901 – 14 April 1990) was a German writer. In 1954, he was awarded the Georg Büchner Prize by the Deutsche Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung. He was born in Plauen and died in Berlin. The New York based literary website complete review has labeled Kessel as one of the almost forgotten authors who "has long bobbed near that surface separating recognition from oblivion, threatening several times to sink from sight".
