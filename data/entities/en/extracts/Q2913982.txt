Trap is a sub-genre of hip hop music that originated in the Southern United States during the late 1990s. The genre gets its name from the Atlanta slang word "trap", which refers to a place in which drugs are sold illegally. Trap music uses synthesized drums and is characterized by complex hi-hat patterns, tuned kick drums with a long decay (originally from the Roland TR-808 drum machine), atmospheric synths, and an often melancholy or dark ambience and lyrical content.  Pioneers of the genre include producers Mannie Fresh, Shawty Redd, and Toomp, along with rappers Young Jeezy, Drama, and T.I. (who coined the term with his 2003 album Trap Muzik). However, the modern trap sound was popularized by producer Lex Luger, who produced the influential Waka Flocka Flame album Flockaveli in 2010 and cofounded the prolific hip hop production team 808 Mafia.
Since crossing over into the mainstream in the 2010s, trap has become one of the most popular forms of American music, consistently dominating the Billboard Hot 100 throughout the decade, with artists such as Drake, Cardi B, Migos, Future, Lil Uzi Vert, 2 Chainz, Kendrick Lamar, Post Malone, XXXTentacion, and Travis Scott (among many others) all achieving No. 1s on the chart with songs that belong to the trap sub-genre. It has influenced the music of many pop artists, such as Ariana Grande, Beyonc√©, Miley Cyrus, Rihanna, and Selena Gomez. Its influence can also be heard in reggaeton and K-pop. In 2018, hip-hop became the most popular form of music for the first time ever (according to Nielsen Data), coinciding with trap's continued rise in popularity. In 2019, the trap-inspired country/rap crossover "Old Town Road" by Lil Nas X (featuring Billy Ray Cyrus) broke the record for spending the most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
