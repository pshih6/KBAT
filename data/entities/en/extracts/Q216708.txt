William John Paul Gallagher (born 21 September 1972) is an English singer and songwriter. He rose to fame as the lead singer of the rock band Oasis in the 1990s and 2000s, and later fronted the rock band Beady Eye in the early 2010s, before beginning a solo career after the dissolution of both bands. One of the most recognisable figures in British music, he is noted for his outspoken and abrasive manner; penchant for wearing parkas; distinctive singing style, in which he elongates vowels; and signature stance on stage, which consists of him holding his arms behind his back and singing up into a downward-facing microphone.
Gallagher's debut solo album, As You Were, was released in October 2017 and proved to be a critical and commercial success. It topped the UK Albums Chart and was the ninth fastest-selling debut album of the 2010s in the UK, with over 103,000 units sold in its first week. In 2018, the album was certified Platinum with sales of over 300,000 units in the UK. His second solo album, Why Me? Why Not, topped the UK charts upon its release in September 2019; his tenth chart-topping album, including eight with Oasis, it was the fastest-selling vinyl of 2019.
