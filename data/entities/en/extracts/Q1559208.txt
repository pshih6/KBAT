Joseph Thyssen, also Josef Thyssen (Eschweiler, 14 February 1844 – Mülheim an der Ruhr, 15 July 1915), was a German industrialist. He was the son of Friedrich Thyssen and the younger brother of August Thyssen, who was also his closest colleague and confidant.
After working with his brother in the banking business of their father, Thyssen was co-owner since 1877 of August Thyssen’s Styrum Mill Thyssen & Co. He held this position in various supervisory and management bodies of the Thyssen Group. Among other things, he was a founding board member of the Mülheim Mining Association from 1898. In 1900 he moved with his family to his newly built Villa Josef Thyssen by the River Ruhr.
In 1880 he married Klara Bagel, the daughter of a Mülheim publishing family (1856–1918). The couple had three children: Julius (1881–1946), Johanna (1883–1887) and Hans (1890–1943). In 1915 Joseph Thyssen died at the Mülheim plant, having fallen between two rail car buffers during an evening patrol. He was buried in the Old Cemetery (Old Cemetery) in Mülheim an de Ruhr.
