Sathya Sai Baba (born Sathyanarayana Raju; 23 November 1926 â€“ 24 April 2011) was an Indian guru and philanthropist. At the age of fourteen he claimed that he was the reincarnation of Shirdi Sai Baba, and encouraged his followers to believe the same.Sathya Sai Baba's purported materialisations of vibhuti (holy ash) and other small objects such as rings, necklaces, and watches, were a source of controversy. Some have analyzed them as being mere sleights of hand; while his followers have considered them as signs of his divinity. Reports of faith healings have been attributed to Sathya Sai Baba by his followers.The Sathya Sai Organisation, founded by Sathya Sai Baba "to enable its members to undertake service activities as a means to spiritual advancement", has over 1,200 Sathya Sai Centres (branches) in 126 countries. Through this organisation, Sathya Sai Baba established a network of free hospitals, clinics, drinking water projects, auditoriums, ashrams and schools.
