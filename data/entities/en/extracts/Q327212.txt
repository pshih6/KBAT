Robert Charles Heaton (6 July 1961 â€“ 4 November 2004) was an English musician best known as the  drummer in the English rock band New Model Army (NMA). Besides being the drummer for the band, Heaton was also responsible for much of the band's songwriting both  lyrically and musically, the musical content of NMA album Thunder and Consolation is essentially exclusively his creation. He was probably the first person to play a synchronous drum and harmonica solo, doing so in the song 'Shot 18' on the No Rest for The Wicked tour. He was the second drummer in NMA but the band's first touring and recording drummer.
