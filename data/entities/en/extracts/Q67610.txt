Heinz Günther Guderian (23 August 1914 – 25 September 2004) was a German officer in the Wehrmacht and later a major general and Inspector of Panzer Troops in the West German Bundeswehr and NATO. He was the son of World War II General Heinz Guderian.
Born in Goslar in what was then the Prussian Province of Hanover, Heinz Günther Guderian entered the German Army as an officer cadet on 1 April 1933. He was promoted to second lieutenant in 1935 and served as a Zugführer (platoon leader), battalion and regimental adjutant and company commander in Panzer Regiments 1 and 35. He saw combat during the invasion of Poland and was wounded twice during the Battle of France in 1940. He graduated from the General Staff College in 1942 and served as a staff officer in various armored units until being assigned as the Operations Officer for the 116th Panzerdivision ("The Greyhounds") in May 1942, a position he held until the end of the War.
He was captured at the conclusion of World War II and held as a prisoner of war until 1947. After the creation of the Bundeswehr, Guderian returned to the army and was given command of Panzerbattalion 3 (later 174) and, later, Panzerbrigade 14.  He also served in a variety of staff assignments, culminating in service as Inspector of Panzer Troops — the same job his father held during World War II — for the Bundeswehr. He retired in 1974.
