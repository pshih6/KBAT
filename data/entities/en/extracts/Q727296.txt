Sami Kein채nen (born 13 May 1973 in Rovaniemi) is a Finnish bass player and a former and founding member of Lordi.
Using the stage name G-Stealer, Kein채nen played the bass in the band from 1996 to 1999 and recorded an album, Bend Over and Pray the Lord! with them. The album was released on September 3, 2012, as a part of the Scarchives Vol. 1. 
In 1999 Kein채nen left the band, as he had gotten a job in Great Britain.As G-Stealer, he was a terrible manbeast from the star system Mu Arae, just like Kita. It was originally thought, that this beast could replace genes of creatures it encounters, so that its name would have been Gene Replacer. This was an inside joke about Kiss's bassist, Gene Simmons and as a band greatly influenced by Kiss, Kein채nen would in effect be Gene's replacer. It was, however, concluded that "replacer" sounded stupid and Gene couldn't really be replaced. In the end, the name was shortened to G-Stealer.
