Sebastian Edathy (German pronunciation: [eˈdaːti]; born 5 September 1969 as Sebastian Edathiparambil) is a former German politician. He is a prominent member of the Social Democratic Party and became the chairman of a key committee in January 2012 at the Parliament, which was investigating failures of police and intelligence units in the serial murders of nine immigrants by the far-right German terrorist group ″National Socialist Underground″ (NSU) from 2000–2007. The NSU committee questioned various officials from Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office during  2012 and 2013. 
His alleged possession of child porn material sparked the Edathy-Affäre.
