Kingfisher Airlines Limited was an airline group based in India.  Through its parent company United Breweries Group, it had a 50% stake in low-cost carrier Kingfisher Red.
Until December 2011, Kingfisher Airlines had the second largest share in India's domestic air travel market. However, the airline ran into continuous losses since its inception, ran high debts and finally closed its operations in 2012. Its chairman Vijay Mallya subsequently fled to London to hide from creditors.
