Kauniainen (Finnish pronunciation: [ˈkɑuniˌɑinen]; Swedish: Grankulla) is a small town and a municipality of 9,559 inhabitants (31 January 2019) in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland. It is surrounded by the City of Espoo, in Greater Helsinki. Kauniainen was founded by a corporation in 1906, AB Grankulla, that parcelled land and created a suburb for villas; Kauniainen received the status of a market town in 1920, the Finnish name in 1949, and the title of kaupunki ("city, town") in 1972.
The municipal taxation rate in Kauniainen is the lowest in Finland (16.5%), which has made the city attractive to high-income families. This in turn makes the average income generally high, making it possible to keep the taxation rate low without compromising the service to the inhabitants.
Approximately 58% of the population have Finnish as their mother tongue while 38% are Swedish speakers. The dominant party in the city council has traditionally been the Swedish People's Party.
