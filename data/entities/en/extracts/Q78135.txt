Hans Heinz Holz (26 February 1927 – 11 December 2011) was a German Marxist philosopher.Born in Frankfurt am Main, he was professor of philosophy at the University of Marburg (from 1971 to 1979) and from 1979 to 1993 at the  University of Groningen. He is known for his encyclopedic knowledge of the history of philosophy on one hand and for his openly expressed ideological viewpoints on the other. Influenced by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's monadology, he regards Widerspiegelung (reflection) not only as an epistemological but also as an ontological category. Some critics spot here a hazard of deviating from materialism. Though Holz saw himself as in footsteps of Lenin, his vision is disputed among the leftist circles. He has contributed to far-left publications like Marxistische Blätter and Weißenseer Blätter. He joined the German Communist Party in 1994.
