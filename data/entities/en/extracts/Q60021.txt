Cabaret Balkan is a 1998 Serbian film directed by Goran Paskaljević starring Miki Manojlović and Nebojša Glogovac. Its original Serbian language title is Буре барута (Bure baruta) which means Powder Keg. It was released in English speaking countries under the title of Cabaret Balkan, with the official reason for the name change being that Kevin Costner had already registered a film project under the title Powder Keg. The film received a number of distinctions, including a FIPRESCI award at the Venice Film Festival in 1998. It was based on a play by the same title by Dejan Dukovski. The film was selected as the Serbian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 71st Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.
