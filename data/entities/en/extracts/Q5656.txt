Héloïse ( or ; French: [e.lɔ.iz]; 1090?/1100–1? – 16 May 1164) was a French nun, writer, scholar, and abbess. Héloïse is accorded an important place in French literary history and in the development of feminist representation. While few of her letters survive, those that do have been considered a foundational "monument" of French literature from the late thirteenth century onwards. Her correspondence, more erudite than it is erotic, is the Latin basis for the bildungsroman and a model of the classical epistolary genre, which influenced writers as diverse as Madame de Lafayette, Choderlos de Laclos, Rousseau and Dominique Aury.
She is best known for her love affair and correspondence with Peter Abelard (French name: Pierre Abélard). She was the daughter born of the scandalous union of Hersint of Champagne Lady of Montsoreau (founder of the Fontevraud Abbey) with the seneschal of France Gilbert of Garlande.
