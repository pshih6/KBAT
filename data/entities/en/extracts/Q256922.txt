Aestheticism (also the Aesthetic Movement) is an intellectual and art movement supporting the emphasis of aesthetic values more than social-political themes for literature, fine art, music and other arts.  This meant that art from this particular movement focused more on being beautiful rather than having a deeper meaning â€” "art for art's sake". It was particularly prominent in Europe during the late 19th century, supported by notable figures such as Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde, but more contemporary critics are also associated with the movement, such as Harold Bloom, who argued against projecting social and political ideology onto literary works, which he believes has been a growing problem in humanities departments over the 20th century.In the 19th century, it was related to other movements such as symbolism or decadence represented in France, or decadentismo represented in Italy, and may be considered the British version of the same style.
