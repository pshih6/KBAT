Corinna or Korinna (Ancient Greek: Κόριννα, romanized: Kórinna) was an ancient Greek lyric poet from Tanagra in Boeotia, described by Herbert Weir Smyth as the most famous ancient Greek woman poet after Sappho.  Although ancient testimonia portray her as a contemporary of Pindar (who lived between about 522 and 443 BC), not all modern scholars accept the accuracy of this tradition, and some claim that she is more likely to have lived in the Hellenistic period of 323 to 31 BC.  Her works, which survive only in fragments, focus on local Boeotian legends.  Her poetry is of interest as the work of one of the few preserved female poets from ancient Greece.
