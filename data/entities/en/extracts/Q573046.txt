He is known for his work with several leading musicians including Geri Allen, Dewey Redman, Dave Douglas, John Scofield, Pat Metheny, Gary Thomas, Marty Ehrlich, Ed Blackwell, Joe Lovano, and Dave King. He plays mainly in the post-bop, avant-garde, and traditional styles, though he is "versatile enough to work in any style effectively."Cox grew up in Minneapolis and attended college at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.  Peter Madsen wrote that Cox is "open to all kinds of great music from around the world" and that "his bass sound is full of beauty and warmth and his ability to accompany and still add very creative ideas into whatever music he is playing is remarkable. He is equally comfortable playing chord changes with a Stan Getz or Kenny Wheeler or playing open music with a Dewey Redman or Geri Allen."
