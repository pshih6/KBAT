Marianne Fredriksson, née Persson (March 28, 1927 in Gothenburg – February 11, 2007 in Österskär) was a Swedish author who worked and lived in Roslagen and Stockholm. Before becoming a novelist, she was a journalist for various Swedish newspapers and magazines, including Svenska Dagbladet.
Fredriksson published fifteen novels, most of which have been translated into English, German, Dutch and other languages. Most of her earlier books are based on biblical stories. A central theme in her writings is friendship because, as she maintained, "friendship will be more important than love" in the future.
