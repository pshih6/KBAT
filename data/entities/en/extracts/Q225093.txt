Company is a 2002 Indian Hindi-language gangster film directed by Ram Gopal Varma and written by Jaideep Sahni. The film stars Mohanlal, Ajay Devgn, debutant Vivek Oberoi, Manisha Koirala, and Antara Mali in the lead roles. It is the second film in the Indian Gangster trilogy, and a sequel to Satya (1998). Company follows Chandu, a henchman of a gangster named Malik, with whom he forms a rapport that eventually falls apart after tension arise between them.
Varma conceived the idea of the film after meeting a man named Haneef, who had been in prison for five years after the 1993 Bombay bombings and was a close aid of the mobster and terrorist Dawood Ibrahim. Haneef told Varma about the fallout between Ibrahim and Chhota Rajan. Varma also had a lot of information which he used in the film, especially about police procedures he could not use in Satya since it was too much for one film. The film was made in several locations of Mumbai, Mombasa, Nairobi, Hong Kong and Switzerland. Hemant Chaturvedi served as the director of photography while Chandan Arora edited the film.
Company was released on 12 April 2002 to positive response. It was a commercial success, grossing ₹25.02 crore against its production budget of ₹7 crore. It was screened at Austin Film Festival, New York Asian Film Festival and the Fribourg International Film Festival. The film won six awards at the 48th Filmfare Awards, including the Best Supporting Actor and Best Male Debut for Oberoi, and Critics Award for Best Actor for Devgn.
