Wolfgang Caspar Printz (10 October 1641 â€“ 13 October 1717), normally referred to as Wolfgang Printz (with sometimes the variation of Kaspar), was a German composer who studied theology and was appointed cantor at Promnitz, Treibel and Sorau. His Historische Beschreibung der edlen Sing- und Klingkunst...von Anfang der Welt bis auf unserer Zeit (which in English means: Historical description of the noble art of singing and instrumental music ... from the beginning of the world until our time) was the first history of music written in Germany.
