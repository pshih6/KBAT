Li Ao (Chinese: 李敖; pinyin: Lǐ Áo, also spelled Lee Ao; 25 April 1935 – 18 March 2018) was a Chinese-Taiwanese writer, social commentator, historian, and independent politician.
Li has been called one of the most important modern East Asian essayists today; his critics have called him as an intellectual narcissist. He was a vocal critic of both the main political parties in Taiwan today, the Kuomintang and the Democratic Progressive Party. Although he favored reunification with the People's Republic of China (PRC), especially under the "One country, two systems" policy, Li rejected being labeled "Pan-Blue" because of his opposition to the Kuomintang. He was an advocate of Chinese nationalism and was given much media exposure in Taiwan due to his popularity as a writer.
