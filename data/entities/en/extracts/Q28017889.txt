Hai-Tang is a 1930 British-German drama film directed by Richard Eichberg and Jean Kemm and starring Anna May Wong, Marcel Vibert and Robert Ancelin. It was made at Elstree Studios as the French-language version of The Flame of Love, which also starred Anna May Wong. A separate German version (The Road to Dishonour) was also released. Such multiple-language versions were common during the early years of sound before dubbing became more widespread.
