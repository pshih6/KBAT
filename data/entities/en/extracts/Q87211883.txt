Karoly Grosz (US: , KAH-roy GROHSS; Hungarian: [ˈkaːroj ˈɡroːs]; fl. 1921–1938) was a Hungarian–American illustrator of Classical Hollywood–era film posters. As art director at Universal Pictures for the bulk of the 1930s, Grosz oversaw the company's advertising campaigns and contributed hundreds of his own illustrations. He is especially recognized for his dramatic, colorful posters for classic horror films.
Grosz's best-known posters advertised early Universal Classic Monsters films such as Dracula (1931), Frankenstein (1931), The Mummy (1932), The Invisible Man (1933), and Bride of Frankenstein (1935). Beyond the horror genre, his other notable designs include posters for the epic war film All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) and the screwball comedy My Man Godfrey (1936). Original lithograph copies of his poster art are scarce and highly valued by collectors. Two posters illustrated by Grosz—ads for Frankenstein and The Mummy, respectively—have set the auction record for the world's most expensive film poster. The latter held the record for nearly 20 years and, at the time of its sale in 1997, it may have been the most expensive art print in any category.
Despite the growth in his artwork's valuation and prominence, very little biographical information about Grosz is known. He was born in Hungary, immigrated to the United States, and worked in American film advertising between approximately 1921 and 1938, possibly earlier and later. Only a small portion of his artistic output has been attributed to him, reflecting the standard anonymity of early American film poster artists.
