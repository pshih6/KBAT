Code Name: Wild Geese (Italian: Arcobaleno selvaggio, German: Geheimcode: Wildg√§nse) is a 1984 West German-Italian Euro War film directed by Antonio Margheriti and starring Lewis Collins in the first of their three mercenary war films. Despite the films title, Code Name: Wild Geese is not the sequel to The Wild Geese film, but a derivative film. Kim Newman described the film as closer to the director's films such as The Last Hunter and Cannibal Apocalypse.
