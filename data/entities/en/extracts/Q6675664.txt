The Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection is a series of DVDs compiling Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies animated shorts, released by Warner Home Video. It was created as a more family-friendly, affordable companion to the higher-priced Looney Tunes Golden Collection sets aimed at collectors. Many of the cartoons included on these sets are also already available, along with many other cartoons, on the Golden Collection sets.
