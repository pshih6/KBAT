Muhammad Jusuf Kalla (listen ; born 15 May 1942) is an Indonesian politician and businessman who served as the 10th and 12th Vice President of Indonesia, the only vice president in Indonesian history to serve two non-consecutive terms in office (2004–2009 and 2014–2019). He was unsuccessful as Golkar's presidential nominee in the 2009 presidential election. Since 2009 Kalla has served as the Chairman of the Indonesian Red Cross Society. Before Kalla declared himself as the running mate for Joko Widodo in the 2014 presidential election, a 2012 poll placed his popularity among likely voters in the top three contenders for the presidency and ahead of his own party's nominee Aburizal Bakrie. He is the first person to hold two non-consecutive terms as Vice President of Indonesia.
