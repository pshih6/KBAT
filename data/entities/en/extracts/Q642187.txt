Jean Anselme Boissel (1 May 1891 – 19 October 1951) was a French architect, journalist, and far right political activist who was convicted of collaboration with Nazi Germany.
A disabled veteran of World War I, Boissel founded Le Front Franc— and the Paris-based periodical, Le Réveil du peuple ([Revival of the People])— which espoused anti-Masonic, anti-parliamentarian, and "antijudéométèque" views. Originally sentenced to death after the war, Boissel died in prison.
