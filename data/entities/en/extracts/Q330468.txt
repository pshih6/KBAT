Om Shanti Om (Hindi pronunciation: [oːm ʃaːnt̪ɪ oːm]) is a 2007 Indian fantasy melodrama film directed and co-written by Farah Khan with Mayur Puri and Mushtaq Shiekh. It stars Shah Rukh Khan as Om, a junior artist in 1977 who has a crush on a secretly married superstar, played by Deepika Padukone in her Hindi film debut. Her lover, a producer played by Arjun Rampal, kills her in a fire; Om witnesses this and dies from the injuries sustained from trying to rescue her. Reincarnated as a superstar in 2007, he seeks to avenge his love. Om Shanti Om also starred Shreyas Talpade, Kirron Kher, Bindu and Javed Sheikh in supporting roles, and saw cameos from many Bollywood celebrities in several sequences and songs.
The film was produced and presented by Shah Rukh's wife Gauri Khan under the banner Red Chillies Entertainment on a budget of ₹350 million. Farah conceived Om Shanti Om while directing the musical Bombay Dreams (2002), which was based on the Indian film industry. After Shah Rukh rejected the first version of her next film Happy New Year, she was reminded of Om Shanti Om; the film's title derives from a similar titled popular song from the 1980 film Karz. The soundtrack album was composed by Vishal–Shekhar, with lyrics written by Javed Akhtar. The background score was performed by Sandeep Chowta. The album received positive reviews and was also commercially successful, becoming the highest-selling album of the year in India.
Released on 9 November 2007, Om Shanti Om earned over ₹1.48 billion worldwide becoming the highest grossing Bollywood film of the year; it received positive reviews, with praise for the performances and the film's narrative. The film won several awards in major Indian film award ceremonies. At 53rd Filmfare Awards, it received 12 nominations, winning for Best Female Debut and Best Special Effects, and also won the National Film Award for Best Production Design.
