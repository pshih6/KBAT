Colour Me Kubrick: A True...ish Story (released in the US as Color Me Kubrick) is a Franco-British comedy-drama film directed by Brian W. Cook and released in 2005. The film stars John Malkovich as Alan Conway, a man who had been impersonating director Stanley Kubrick since the early 1990s. The film follows the exploits of Conway as he goes from person to person, convincing them to give out money, liquor and sexual favours for the promise of a part in "Kubrick's" next film. The soundtrack, Colour Me Kubrick: The Original Soundtrack featured five songs co-written by Bryan Adams.
