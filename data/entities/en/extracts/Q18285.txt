Zhu Rongji (Chinese: 朱镕基; IPA: [ʈʂú ɻʊ̌ŋ.tɕí]; born 23 October 1928) is a retired Chinese politician who served as Mayor and Party chief in Shanghai from 1988 to 1991 and as First Vice Premier and then Premier of the People's Republic of China from March 1998 to March 2003.
A tough administrator, his time in office saw continued double-digit growth of the Chinese economy and China's increased assertiveness in international affairs. Rumored to have a testy relationship with Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, under whom he served, Zhu provided a novel pragmatism and strong work ethic in the increasingly corrupt government and party leadership, and as a result gained great popularity with the Chinese public. His opponents, however, charge that Zhu's tough and pragmatic stance on policy was unrealistic and unnecessary, and many of his promises were left unfulfilled. Zhu retired in 2004 and has not been a public figure since.
