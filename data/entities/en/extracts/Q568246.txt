Shady Records is an American record label founded in 1999 by rapper Eminem and his manager Paul Rosenberg, after the highly successful release of Eminem's The Slim Shady LP. Both serve as the label's presidents.
Since its formation, Shady has signed twelve acts and is currently home to four. It has also been part of the business venture in Shade 45 radio station via Sirius Satellite Radio, and had its own dedicated special edition magazine via XXL magazine. Tough times were seen when Eminem, along with the artists were involved in very public feuds with one-time former affiliate Royce da 5'9", Murder Inc. and The Source magazine.
Shady has also seen positive times when being part of the successful international Anger Management tours and, in 2006, released an album showcasing its then-roster on Eminem Presents: The Re-Up. It was also Shady to be contracted for putting together the soundtrack to the Eminem-starring film 8 Mile, which had the lead single "Lose Yourself". The song went on to be the first ever song in the hip hop genre to receive an Academy Award for Best Original Song.
Shady's acts over the years have earned RIAA certifications of gold or higher on 12 of its 21 released albums (excluding Eminem's solo releases). Signed acts include Eminem, Bad Meets Evil, Griselda and Boogie, while former acts include D12, Obie Trice, 50 Cent, Stat Quo, Bobby Creekwater, Cashis, Slaughterhouse and Yelawolf.
