Calvin Hoffman (1906 â€“ February 1986), born Leo Hochman in Brooklyn, NY, was an American theater critic, press agent and writer who popularized in his 1955 book The murder of the man Who Was Shakespeare the Marlovian theory that playwright Christopher Marlowe was the actual author of the works attributed to William Shakespeare. Like other alternate Shakespearean authorship theories, Hoffman's claims have been largely dismissed by mainstream Shakespearean scholars.
