Louis Bromfield (December 27, 1896 â€“ March 18, 1956) was an American author and conservationist. A best-selling novelist in the 1920s, he reinvented himself as a farmer in the late 1930s and became one of the earliest proponents of sustainable and organic agriculture in the United States. He won the Pulitzer Prize, founded the experimental Malabar Farm in Ohio, and played an important role in the early environmental movement.
