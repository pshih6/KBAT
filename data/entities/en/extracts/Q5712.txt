Southwest Finland, directly translated as Finland Proper (Finnish: Varsinais-Suomi; Swedish: Egentliga Finland), is a region in the Southwest of Finland. It borders the regions of Satakunta, Pirkanmaa, Tavastia Proper (Kanta-Häme), Uusimaa, and Åland. The region's capital and most populous city is Turku.
The area comprising the Southwest is largely the same as the historical province of Finland Proper, so named because it is the original home of the tribe known as the Finns.
