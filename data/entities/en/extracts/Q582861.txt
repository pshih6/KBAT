The Marinid Sultanate covered present-day Morocco and, intermittently, parts of North Africa and southern Spain around Gibraltar, from the mid-13th to the 15th century. It was ruled by the Marinid dynasty (Berber: ⴰⵢⵜ ⵎⵔⵉⵏ ayt mrin; Arabic: المرينيون‎ al-marīniyyūn), or Banu Abd al-Haqq, a Sunni Muslim family of Zenata Berber descent.In 1244, the Marinid rulers overthrew the Almohad Caliphate, which had controlled present-day Morocco. The Marinid dynasty briefly held sway over all the Maghreb in the mid-14th century. It supported the Kingdom of Granada in al-Andalus in the 13th and 14th centuries; an attempt to gain a direct foothold on the European side of the Strait of Gibraltar was however defeated at the Battle of Río Salado in 1340 and finished after the Castilian conquest of Algeciras from the Marinids in 1344.The Marinids were overthrown after the 1465 Moroccan revolt. The Wattasid dynasty, a related ruling house, came to power in 1472.
