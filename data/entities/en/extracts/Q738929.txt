The Braxtons is an American musical quintet consisting of singer Toni Braxton and her sisters, Traci Braxton, Towanda Braxton, Trina Braxton, and Tamar Braxton. Despite being commercially unsuccessful, the group's first single, "Good Life", led to oldest sister Toni Braxton's solo career. All five members reunited in 2011 to star in the WE tv reality television series Braxton Family Values alongside their mother, Evelyn Braxton.
In October 2015, the group released the album Braxton Family Christmas.
