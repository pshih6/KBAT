Tito and Me (Serbian: Тито и ја, Tito i ja) is a 1992 Yugoslav comedy film by Serbian director Goran Marković. The film was made during one of the most difficult periods in the history of the Balkans. Its quirky humor marked the beginning of the end for the country it celebrates and mercilessly criticises at the same time.
