Barenaked in America is a 1999 documentary film about the Canadian band Barenaked Ladies filmed during the 1998-1999 Stunt tour. Directed by actor Jason Priestley, the film was first shown at the Toronto International Film Festival. The band and director introduced the film at the Winter Garden theatre.   
Barenaked in America was originally released in the United States through a distribution deal with Blockbuster Video, and was available only for rental in VHS format. Blockbuster put many of its remaining copies on the sale rack, in an effort to eliminate its inventory, after their exclusive deal had expired. 
Barenaked in America has since been released on DVD in territories outside of North America, and has run on premium movie channels in the US. However, due to a rights issue, the film was not released for sale in the U.S. until on June 1, 2018, the band announced that a 20th Anniversary Edition of Stunt would be released in September that would include a CD/DVD package featuring the Barenaked in America.
