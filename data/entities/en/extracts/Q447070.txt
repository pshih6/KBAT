Lauryssens will be played by Cillian Murphy, with Al Pacino as Dalí.His non-fiction books were serialised in The Mail on Sunday and are published in English, French, Italian and Polish and have gained cult status in Japan. His first thriller, Black Snow, won him the Hercule Poirot Award 2002 for best crime fiction of the year, and was followed by Dead Corpses (2003) and Red Roses (2004), Deader Than Dead Too (2005), More than Naked (2005), No Time for Tears (2006) and "The Sooner You Die". Translation rights for "Dalí & I: The Surreal Story" have been sold in some 30 languages. The book is also out as an Amazon Kindle Edition and on CD, from Tantor Media.
Lauryssens is currently working on a memoir tentatively titled A Curry at Night and Sex on Sunday. This story will recount his seven years as an outcast in an Indian family in the London suburbs that ended with him living for a couple of days in "cardboard city" under Waterloo Bridge.
