Francisco Everardo Oliveira Silva (born 1 May 1965), best known by his stage name Tiririca, is a Brazilian actor, clown, comedian, humorist, politician and singer-songwriter. He currently represents the state of São Paulo as a representative in the Chamber of Deputies of the National Congress of Brazil.
Tiririca first met national prominence as a singer-songwriter, when his first album Florentina (1997) topped charts. Proving to be a one-hit wonder, he abandoned his musical career after recording two more albums and started work as an actor and comedian in television. Later, again received attention in Brazilian media in 2010, during his run for representative for São Paulo in the lower house Congress, eventually becoming the second-most-voted congressman in Brazil's history.
