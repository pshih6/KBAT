The Pakistan Peoples Party (Urdu: پاکستان پیپلز پارٹی‎, romanized: Pakstan pyplz party, PPP) is a centre-left, social-democratic political party of Pakistan. Affiliated with the Socialist International, the PPP promotes in her own view social justice and a strong national defence.Since its foundation in 1967, it had been a major and influential political left-wing and socialist force in the country and the party's leadership has been dominated by the members of the Bhutto family. Its centre of power lies in the southern province of Sindh.Since its formation in 1967, the PPP has been voted into power on five separate occasions (1970, 1977, 1988, 1993 and 2008). It dominated the politics of Pakistan during the 1970s, suffering a temporary decline during the military dictatorship of Zia-ul-Haq. After the re-establishment of democracy in 1988 following Zia's death, a two-party system developed, with the PPP and the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad, later succeeded by the Pakistan Muslim League (N), as the two major sides. The party served as the principal opposition to the Pervez Musharraf-led social liberal government from 1999 to 2008. Until the disqualification of Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani by the Supreme Court in 2012, the PPP was regarded as the most influential political party in the country. During the 2013 general election, it emerged as the governing party of Sindh and the largest opposition party in the National Assembly)
