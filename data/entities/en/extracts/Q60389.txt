Johannes Althusius (1557 â€“ August 12, 1638) was a German jurist and Calvinist political philosopher.
He is best known for his 1603 work, "Politica Methodice Digesta, Atque Exemplis Sacris et Profanis Illustrata". revised editions were published in 1610 and 1614.  The ideas expressed therein relate to the early development of federalism in the 16th and 17th centuries and the construction of subsidiarity.
