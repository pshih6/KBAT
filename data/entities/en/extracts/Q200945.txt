Châtenay-Malabry is a commune in the southwestern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located 10.8 km (6.7 mi) from the center of Paris.
The French writer Chateaubriand lived in the estate Vallée-aux-Loups at Châtenay-Malabry. The Garden City in the Butte Rouge, the Cité Jardins, is one of the earliest examples of housing at moderated rents (HLM).
Châtenay is the location of École Centrale Paris, of the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Paris-Sud and of French national laboratory of doping detection. It is also the home of the Arboretum de la Vallée-aux-Loups. The high-speed LGV Atlantique crosses the city through a tunnel covered by a park called Coulée verte (greenway).
Since 31 December 2002, it has been part of the Agglomeration community of Hauts de Bièvre, which merged into the Métropole du Grand Paris in January 2016.
