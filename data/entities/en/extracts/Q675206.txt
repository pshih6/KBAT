Lesley Duncan (married name Lesley Cox; 12 August 1943 â€“ 12 March 2010) was an English singer-songwriter, best known for her work during the 1970s. She received a lot of airplay on British radio stations such as BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2; but never achieved great commercial success, in part because of her unwillingness to chase stardom, and crippling stage fright.
