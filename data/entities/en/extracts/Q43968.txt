The Trapp Family (German: Die Trapp-Familie) is a 1956 West German comedy drama film about the real-life Austrian musical family of that name directed by Wolfgang Liebeneiner and starring Ruth Leuwerik, Hans Holt, and Maria Holst. Based on Maria von Trapp's memoir, The Story of the Trapp Family Singers, the film is about a novice nun sent to care for the unruly children of a wealthy baron, who falls in love with and marries the young woman. Through her caring influence, the family becomes a famous singing group. When the baron is pressured to join Hitler's army, the family escapes to the United States where they establish themselves as singers.
The Trapp Family became one of the most successful German films of the 1950s, and was the inspiration for the even more fictionalized Broadway musical The Sound of Music and its highly successful 1965 film version. The film had one sequel, The Trapp Family in America.
