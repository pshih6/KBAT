The Haunting in Connecticut is a 2009 American supernatural horror film produced by Gold Circle Films and directed by Peter Cornwell. The film is alleged to be about Carmen Snedeker and her family, though Ray Garton, author of In a Dark Place: The Story of a True Haunting (1992), has publicly distanced himself from the accuracy of the events he depicted in the book. The film's story follows the fictional Campbells as they move into a house (a former mortuary) to mitigate the strains of travel on their cancer-stricken son, Matt. The family soon becomes haunted by violent and traumatic events from supernatural forces occupying the house.
Although the film was moderately successful at the box office, grossing $77,527,732, it received "generally unfavorable reviews" according to Metacritic. In 2010 Gold Circle Films announced the production of two more entries in the franchise, The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia (released 2013) and The Amityville Murders: A Haunting on Long Island. They noted, however, that neither film would be a direct sequel to The Haunting in Connecticut and would instead be self-contained films with unique characters.
