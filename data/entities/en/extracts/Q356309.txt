Frederick Martin MacMurray (August 30, 1908 â€“ November 5, 1991) was an American actor and singer who appeared in more than 100 films and a successful television series during a career that spanned nearly a half-century, from 1930 to the 1970s.
His career as a major movie leading man began in 1935 but MacMurray is best known for his role in the 1944 film noir Double Indemnity directed by Billy Wilder, in which he starred with Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. As he grew older, he performed in numerous Disney films, including The Absent-Minded Professor, The Happiest Millionaire, and The Shaggy Dog.  In 1960, MacMurray turned to television in the role of Steve Douglas, the widowed patriarch on My Three Sons, which ran on ABC from 1960 to 1965 and then on CBS from 1965 to 1972, a twelve-year span during which MacMurray's scenes were filmed together for three months every season so that he could take the rest of the year off.
