Jail Bait (also known as Hidden Face) is a 1954 American film noir directed by Ed Wood, with a screenplay by Wood and Alex Gordon.  The film stars Clancy Malone as the delinquent son of a famous doctor, and his involvement with a dangerous criminal.  Famed bodybuilder Steve Reeves made his first major screen appearance in the film, and it was one of the few films he made using his own voice (most of the films he made thereafter in Italy were dubbed in post production using other actors' voices). The film belongs to the film noir genre, and contains themes typical of it such as plastic surgery and identity theft.
