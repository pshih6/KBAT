Baroness Daisy von Freyberg zu Eisenberg, known professionally as Daisy D'ora, (26 February 1913 â€“ 12 June 2010) was a German beauty queen, socialite and actress.
Born in Potsdam, Germany to an impoverished aristocratic family, she began her career in silent films, performing in the 1929 film Pandora's Box, starring Louise Brooks, which became a worldwide success. She earned acclaim for her star turn in The Missing Testament (1929), and appeared in a number of German features before leaving the screen around 1930. Her stage name was coined as a result of the taboo among German aristocratic families against using family names in mainstream industries. In May 1931, she was encouraged to enter the Miss Germany pageant, which would in turn take her to the Miss Universe contest.
