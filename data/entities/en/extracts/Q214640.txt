Brzeg ([bʐɛk] (listen); Latin: Alta Ripa, former German name: Brieg) is a town in southwestern Poland with 35,890 inhabitants (2017) and the capital of Brzeg County. It is situated in Silesia in the Opole Voivodeship on the left bank of the Oder.
The town of Brzeg was first mentioned as a trading and fishing settlement in the year 1234. In 1248, Silesian Duke Henry III the White granted the settlement German town rights and by the late 13th century the city became fortified. Sometimes referred to as “the garden town”, the town's size greatly expanded after the construction of dwelling houses which were located on the city outskirts.
From the early 14th to late 17th centuries, the town was ruled by the Piast dynasty, the first historical ruling dynasty of Poland. It then came under the control of the Bohemian Crown within the Holy Roman Empire and became part of Germany.
After Germany's defeat in World War II, the town became part of Poland.
