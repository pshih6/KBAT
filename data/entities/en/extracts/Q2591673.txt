Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture (Aalto ARTS; Finnish: Aalto-yliopiston taiteiden ja suunnittelun korkeakoulu; Swedish: Aalto-universitetets högskola för konst, design och arkitektur), was formed of two separate schools: the faculty of architecture (previously part of the Helsinki University of Technology) and the University of Art and Design Helsinki (UAIH, known in Finnish as TaiK). TaiK, founded in 1871, was the largest art university in the Nordic countries. The Media Centre Lume – the National Research and Development Center of audiovisual media – is also located in the university. The university awards the following academic degrees: Bachelor of Science in Technology, Architect, Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, and Doctor of Arts.
The university is known for its research projects and industrial collaborations. During the rectorship of Yrjö Sotamaa the university was active in integrating design into Finnish innovation and business networks. This eventually led to the decision to merge TaiK together with Helsinki University of Technology (TKK) and the Helsinki School of Economics (HSE) into a new charter university, Aalto University, which started in January 2010.
In the QS World University Rankings in 2018, the Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture was placed 9th in the art and design subject area, in 2018 it was placed 9th.
