Rudolf Herrnstadt (18 March 1903 – 28 August 1966) was a German journalist and communist politician – most notable for his anti-fascist activity as an exile from the Nazi German regime in the Soviet Union during the war and as a journalist in East Germany until his death, where he and Wilhelm Zaisser represented the anti-Ulbricht wing of the Socialist Unity Party (SED) in the 1950s.
Herrnstadt actively provided intelligence about Nazi Germany and Poland to the Soviet Union in the 1930s.
