From 3 February 1945 he served under Otto Förschner as deputy commander of Kaufering concentration camp, a subsidiary network of the larger Dachau camp, remaining in that role until the camp's evacuation in late April of the same year.Schöttl was captured by the United States Army and on 15 November was indicted for war crimes as part of the Dachau Trials. Reports of his mistreatment of prisoners, as well as the shooting of another prisoner, were taken into account and, on 13 December 1945, he was one of 36 defendants sentenced to death by hanging. His execution was carried out in Landsberg Prison on 28 May 1946.
