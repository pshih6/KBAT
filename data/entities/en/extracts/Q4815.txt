Percy's Progress is a 1974 British comedy film directed by Ralph Thomas.  It was written by Sid Colin, Harry H. Corbett and Ian La Frenais.  It was released in the United States under the title It's Not the Size That Counts. The US version of the film includes several additional scenes shot by the American distributor, which include an opening scene of a penis transplant operation, and a scene in which a dwarf is seen jumping out of a woman's bed, leaving her to say the film's American title, "It's not the size that counts."  The dwarf in question was Luis De Jesus, the star of the infamous Blood Sucking Freaks.
Harry H. Corbett's character was closely modelled on British prime minister Harold Wilson, down to using well-known Wilson phrases such as "thirteen years of Tory misrule" and speaking with a distinct Yorkshire accent.
The film is a sequel to Percy, which was itself based on a novel of the same name by Raymond Hitchcock.
