Cornelis Floris or Cornelis (II) Floris De Vriendt (1514 â€“ 20 October 1575) was a Flemish sculptor, print artist and architect.  He developed a new style, which was informed by Flemish traditions, the 16th century Italian renaissance and possibly the School of Fontainebleau. His innovations spread throughout Northern Europe where they had a major influence on the development of sculpture and architecture in the 16th and early 17th centuries.
