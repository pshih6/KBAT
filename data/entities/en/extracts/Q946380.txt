The All-Russian Central Executive Committee (Russian: Всероссийский Центральный Исполнительный Комитет, tr. Vserossiysky Centralny Ispolnitelny Komitet, VTsIK) was the highest legislative, administrative and revising body of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR) from 1917 until 1937. Although the All-Russian Congress of Soviets had supreme authority, in periods between its sessions its powers were passed to VTsIK.
