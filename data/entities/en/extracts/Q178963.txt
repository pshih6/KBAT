Fereydoun Farrokhzad (Persian: فریدون فرخ زاد‎) (October 7, 1936 – August 7, 1992) was an Iranian singer, actor, poet, TV and radio host, writer, humanitarian and political opposition figure. He is best known for his variety TV show "Mikhak-e Noghrei" (The Silver Carnation) which introduced many artists such as Ebi, Leila Forouhar, Shohreh, Sattar and many more. He was the brother of the acclaimed Persian poets Forough Farrokhzad and Pooran Farrokhzad.
Farrokhzad was forced into exile after the Islamic Revolution in 1979, and after relocating to Germany was the victim of an unsolved murder. The murder is widely believed to be the work of the Islamic Republic government of Iran, as part of the chain murders in 1988–98.
