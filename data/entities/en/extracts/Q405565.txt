Aimée Rachel Osbourne (born 2 September 1983) is an English-American actress and musician. She is the eldest daughter of Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne. While her siblings Jack and Kelly achieved pop culture fame for appearing in the family's MTV reality series The Osbournes, the more private Aimée declined to appear on the show, feeling that doing so would typecast her and affect her musical career. She has expressed discomfort with some of her parents' behavior on television.
