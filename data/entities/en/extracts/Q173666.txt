Gene Force (June 15, 1916 – August 21, 1983) was an American racecar driver.
Born in New Madison, Ohio, Force died in Brooklyn, Michigan as a result a heart attack at Michigan International Speedway.  He drove in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1951–1952, 1954, 1956, and 1958-1960 seasons with 33 starts, including the 1951 and 1960 Indianapolis 500 races.  He finished in the top ten 16 times, with his best career finish in 3rd place occurring on 3 occasions.
The "McKay Special" #37 car that Force drove in the 1960 Indianapolis 500 was a 1959 Kurtis Kraft 500J, owned and entered  by Roy McKay of Dayton, Ohio. Charlie Altfater was the mechanic. The car has survived in largely original condition and is now restored to appear as it did in the 1960 race, and can occasionally be seen participating in vintage races, as it did at the 2008 Monterey historics.
