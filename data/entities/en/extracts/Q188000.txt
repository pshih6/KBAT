Crash is a 2004 American drama film produced, directed, and co-written by Paul Haggis. The film features racial and social tensions in Los Angeles. A self-described "passion piece" for Haggis, Crash was inspired by a real-life incident in which his Porsche was carjacked in 1991 outside a video store on Wilshire Boulevard. The film features an ensemble cast, including Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, William Fichtner,  Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges, Thandie Newton, Michael Pe√±a, and Ryan Phillippe.
Crash first premiered at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2004 before it was released in theaters on May 6, 2005 by Lionsgate Films. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the directing, screenplay, performances (particularly from Dillon), but earned polarized responses for its depiction and portrayal of race relations. The film was profitable at the box office, earning $98.4 million worldwide against its $6.5 million budget. 
The film earned several accolades and nominations. Dillon was particularly praised for his performance and received Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor. Additionally, the cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. The film received six Academy Award nominations, and controversially won three for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Film Editing at the 78th Academy Awards.
