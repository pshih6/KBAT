John Claudius Loudon (8 April 1783 â€“ 14 December 1843) was a Scottish botanist, garden designer and author. He was the first to use the term arboretum in writing to refer to a garden of plants, especially trees, collected for the purpose of scientific study. The standard author abbreviation Loudon is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.
