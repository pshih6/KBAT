Piz Scerscen (3,971 m) is a mountain in the Bernina Range in Switzerland and Italy, joining the neighbouring Piz Bernina by its north-east ridge via a 3,895 m pass. Its name means 'the circular mountain' ('Scerscen' is pronounced cherchen).
The mountain has a prominent secondary summit called the Schneehaube (3,875 m).
The first ascent of Piz Scerscen was by Paul Güssfeldt, Hans Grass and Caspar Capat on 13 September 1877 via the north-west spur, descending the same way. This is the well-known Eisnase route, involving a 100-metre ice pitch of between 60–70°, although its precise length and steepness are debated.[1] 
. This was the route followed by Walter Risch on the first solo ascent of the mountain in 1924. The first ascent of the north-west face was by Christian Klucker and L. Norman-Neruda on 9 July 1890.
