The Deutscher Werkbund (German Association of Craftsmen; German: [ˈdɔʏtʃər ˈvɛrkbʊnd]) is a German association of artists, architects, designers, and industrialists, established in 1907. The Werkbund became an important element in the development of modern architecture and industrial design, particularly in the later creation of the Bauhaus school of design. Its initial purpose was to establish a partnership of product manufacturers with design professionals to improve the competitiveness of German companies in global markets. The Werkbund was less an artistic movement than a state-sponsored effort to integrate traditional crafts and industrial mass production techniques, to put Germany on a competitive footing with England and the United States.  Its motto Vom Sofakissen zum Städtebau (from sofa cushions to city-building) indicates its range of interest.
