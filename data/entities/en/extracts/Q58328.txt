Jean-Baptiste Biot (; French: [bjo]; 21 April 1774 â€“ 3 February 1862) was a French physicist, astronomer, and mathematician who established the reality of meteorites, made an early balloon flight, and studied the polarization of light.
The mineral biotite and Cape Biot in Greenland were named in his honor.
