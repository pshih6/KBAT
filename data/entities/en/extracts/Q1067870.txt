Charterhouse is a boarding school in Godalming, Surrey. Originally founded by Thomas Sutton in 1611 on the site of the old Carthusian monastery in Charterhouse Square, Smithfield, London, it educates over 800 pupils, aged 13 to 18 years, and is one of the original Great Nine English public schools. Today pupils are still referred to as Carthusians, and ex-pupils as Old Carthusians.
Charterhouse charges full boarders up to Â£39,165 per annum (2018/19) and is among the most expensive Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) schools in the UK. It has educated one British Prime Minister and has a long list of notable alumni.
