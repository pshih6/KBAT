Perouz Artin Kalfayan (Armenian: Փիրուզ Արթին Կալֆայան, 15 March 1943 – 30 January 2016), better known as Feyrouz, was an Egyptian film child actress.
Kalfayan was born in Cairo, Egypt, on 15 March 1943, to an Armenian Egyptian family, who could trace their origins to Aleppo, Syria. Her sister, Nelly Kalfaian, also entered the entertainment industry. Her birth name, Perouz, was an Armenian name, likely a form of Feyrouz. She began her acting career very young, making her debut at the age of 7 in the 1950 film Yasmine. Egyptian director Anwar Wagdi was helpful to her in her career. She ultimately retired from acting at 15, in 1959, to wed Badreddine Gamgoum, an Egyptian Palestinian comedian. The couple had two children together, Iman and Ayman.
