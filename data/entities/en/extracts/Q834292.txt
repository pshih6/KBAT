Vorkriegsjugend (German pronunciation: [ˈfoːɐ̯kʁiːksjuːɡənt]) was a very influential cult Deutschpunk/hardcore punk band from West Berlin, Germany. The band existed for only three years (1982–84). However, it is considered to be one of the most notable and influential German bands of the period.
The name translates as "Pre-war youth".
Vorkriegsjugend released a double 7" record and an LP. The band's discography is currently available on CD from Weird System Records.
The band, with only the drummer as a band member of the original line-up, reformed in 1998 and released an EP called Widerstand dem Teutonenland. The band split up for good in 1999.
The LP is nowadays a rarity and can be sold for more than 50 dollars. The front cover painting was done by Lisa Deanne Smith (aka Lisa Bat). The 7" is even more rare. There was an official re-release as 12" by New Face Records from Brazil in 1988. The original 7" had no second pressing and can be sold for more than 150 dollars which makes it one of the most expensive German punk records in history.
