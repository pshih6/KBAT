Lilit Pipoyan (Armenian: Լիլիթ Պիպոյան; born June 16, 1955) is an Armenian musician, singer, and architect.
Pipoyan belongs to that narrow circle of modern Armenian musicians whose works present an alternative to the traditional folk, classical, spiritual and pop music. Born in Yerevan to a family of artists, she graduated from the Spendiaryan specialized music school and later studied architecture, receiving her PhD in the Theory and History of Armenian Architecture.
Pipoyan's compositions are based on Armenian poetry and folklore. She is fond of medieval secular songs, for which she creates modern arrangements or new melodies when the originals are lost, with distinctly Armenian character.
She also composes music based on modern Armenian poetry. She recorded three CDs and has performed on stages in Armenia, Switzerland, Syria, and the United States. She lives in Yerevan with her husband and two children.
