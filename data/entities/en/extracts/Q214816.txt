Pierre Bayle (French: [bɛl]; 18 November 1647 – 28 December 1706) was a French philosopher and writer best known for his seminal work the Historical and Critical Dictionary, publication beginning in 1697.
Bayle was a French Calvinist. As a forerunner of the Encyclopedists and an advocate of the principle of toleration, his works subsequently influenced the development of the Enlightenment.
