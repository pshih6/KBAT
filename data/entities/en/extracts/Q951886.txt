Stephen Randall Glass (born September 15, 1972) is an American former journalist, who is currently employed at a law firm in Beverly Hills.  In 1998, it was revealed that many of his published articles were fabrications. Over a three-year period as a young reporter at The New Republic, Glass invented quotations, sources, and events in articles he wrote for that magazine and others. Most of Glass's articles were of the entertaining and humorous type. Some were based entirely on fictional events. Several seemed to endorse negative stereotypes about ethnic and political groups. In 2016, Glass revealed that he had repaid over $200,000 to The New Republic and other publications for his earlier fabrications.Glass holds a Juris Doctor degree from Georgetown University Law Center. Although he passed the bar exam in both New York and California, he withdrew his application to become a licensed attorney in New York in 2004 after being advised it would not succeed. In 2014, the California Supreme Court unanimously ruled that he should not be licensed in that state. Glass worked as a paralegal at a law firm for a number of years and was later promoted to Director of Special Projects and Trial Team Coordinator.His career at The New Republic was dramatized in the 2003 film Shattered Glass in which Glass was portrayed by Hayden Christensen. Glass fictionalized his own story in The Fabulist (2003), a novel whose protagonist is named "Stephen Aaron Glass".
