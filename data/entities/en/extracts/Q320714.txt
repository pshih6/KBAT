Aaron Aleksandrovich Soltz (Russian: Аарон Александрович Сольц; 10 March 1872 - 30 April 1945) was an Old Bolshevik and a Soviet politician and lawyer. He was informally known as the "conscience of the Party". While partially responsible for the Soviet repressions he was one of very few high-ranking Joseph Stalin loyalists who openly objected to the Great Purge; he died in a psychiatric clinic after years of involuntary commitment.
