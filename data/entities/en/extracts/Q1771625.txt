Anton Alexeevich Bakov (Russian: Антон Алексеевич Баков; born 29 December 1965) is a businessman, monarchist politician, traveller, writer and human rights activist. He is the chairman of the Russian Monarchist Party and was a member of the 4th convocation of the State Duma of the Russian Federation from 2003 to 2007. Due to being known for a long series of unusual political projects such as Ural franc, the writer Alexei Ivanov coined him a "political Leonardo".Bakov claims to have restored the Russian Empire through his establishment of the micronation of the Imperial Throne in 2011. In 2014, the Imperial Throne issued a manifesto announcing that German Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen had succeeded Nicholas II and is now Emperor Nicholas III. In 2017, the micronation was re-branded into Romanov Empire, and it was announced the African nation of The Gambia had begun the process of its state recognition. Under this regime, Bakov holds the position of Archchancellor and bears the title of "His Serene Highness Prince" (Knyaz).
