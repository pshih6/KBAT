Ernst Glaeser (29 July 1902 â€“ 8 February 1963) was a German author, known for his best-selling pacifist novel Jahrgang 1902 ("Born in 1902"). He was associated with the political left, and went into exile in Switzerland at the start of the Nazi era after his books had been publicly burned. However, he returned to Germany in 1939, a decision that was attacked by other exiles.
