François Périer (born François Pillu; 10 November 1919 – 29 June 2002), was a French actor renowned for his expressiveness and diversity of roles.
He made over 110 film and TV appearances between 1938 and 1996, with notable excursion into the French avant-garde. He was also prominent in the theatre. Among his best-known parts was that of Hugo in the first production of Jean-Paul Sartre's Les Mains Sales in 1948. He was the narrator of the French-language version of Fantasia, and made several commercial audio recordings (with commentary) popularizing classical music in France.
