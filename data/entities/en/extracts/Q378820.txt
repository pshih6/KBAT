NASA Astronaut Group 10 (nicknamed "The Maggots") was a group of 17 astronauts that were selected in 1984 and consisted of seven pilots and ten mission specialists. Although selected in 1984, no member of the group would fly until 1988 (William Shepherd on STS-27) due to the Challenger disaster and the resulting grounding of the Space Shuttle fleet.
