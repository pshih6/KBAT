Oomph! is a German rock band from Wolfsburg, formed in 1989. The band pioneered the Neue Deutsche HÃ¤rte movement. Since the band's formation there have been no line-up changes, except for temporary personnel for live performances. They use lyrics in both English and German with a shift from mainly English songs to more German ones on recent albums with the exception of their recent Compilation albums, Delikatessen and Truth or Dare. (GlaubeLiebeTod, Monster, Des Wahnsinns fette Beute, XXV, and Ritual are entirely in German).
