Rajat Kumar Gupta (Bengali pronunciation: [ɾɔdʒot kumaɾ ɡupto]; born (1948-12-02)December 2, 1948) is an Indian-American businessman who, as CEO, was the first foreign-born managing director of management consultancy firm McKinsey & Company from 1994 to 2003. In 2012, he was convicted for insider trading and spent two years in jail. Gupta was a board member of corporations including Goldman Sachs, Procter & Gamble and American Airlines, and an advisor to non-profits such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. He is the co-founder of the Indian School of Business, American India Foundation, New Silk Route and Scandent Solutions.
Gupta was convicted in June 2012 on insider trading charges of four criminal felony counts of conspiracy and securities fraud in the Galleon scandal. He was sentenced in October 2012 to two years in prison, an additional year on supervised release and ordered to pay $5 million in fines. His conviction was upheld by a Federal Appeals Court on March 25, 2014. He then lodged an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court which was subsequently upheld in April 2015. An application to remain free until the court determined whether it would hear the appeal was denied in June 2014 leaving Gupta having to commence his two-year prison term that month. He was released on monitored house arrest in January 2016 and from house arrest in March 2016.
Gupta's memoir, Mind Without Fear, was published by Juggernaut Books and released in March 2019. In a detailed one hour interview subsequently, he described his side of the story, which he said he did not speak of during his trial, based on the advice of his lawyers.
