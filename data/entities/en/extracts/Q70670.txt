Elisabeth Adelheid Hildegard von Thadden (29 July 1890 – 8 September 1944, executed) was a German progressive educator and a resistance fighter against the Nazi régime as a member of the Solf Circle. She was put to death in the wake of the 20 July plot, although it appears highly unlikely that she was involved in any plot to overthrow the Nazis.
