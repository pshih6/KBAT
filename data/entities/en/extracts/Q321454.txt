Female Perversions is a 1996 drama film, the first feature directed by Susan Streitfeld, which stars Tilda Swinton, Amy Madigan, Karen Sillas, Frances Fisher, Paulina Porizkova and Clancy Brown. It draws on insights from the 1991 book Female Perversions: The Temptations of Emma Bovary by the New York psychoanalyst Louise J. Kaplan. Aspects of female psychology, particularly the more morbid, are explored through the interactions of the characters and through their fantasies.
