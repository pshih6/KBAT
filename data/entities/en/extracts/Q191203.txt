Eadwig, also spelled Edwy (c. 940 – October 959), sometimes called the All-Fair, was King of England from 955 until his premature death.
The elder son of Edmund I and Ælfgifu of Shaftesbury, Eadwig became king in 955 aged 15 following the death of his uncle Eadred. Eadwig's short reign was tarnished by disputes with nobles and men of the church, including Archbishops Dunstan and Oda. He died in 959, having ruled less than four years. He was buried in the capital Winchester. His brother Edgar the Peaceful succeeded him.
