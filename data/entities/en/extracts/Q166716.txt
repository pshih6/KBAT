Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning is a 2012 American science fiction action film co-written, co-edited and directed by John Hyams. The film stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren, who both reprise their roles from the first film, with Scott Adkins and Andrei Arlovski also star. It is the fourth and final theatrical installment in the Universal Soldier series.
The film acts as a semi-sequel to its 2009 predecessor, Universal Soldier: Regeneration and likewise, is unrelated to the two television sequels and ignores the events of the 1999 theatrical sequel Universal Soldier: The Return. In the film, a young former military man named John awakens from a coma and finds out that his wife and daughter have been murdered in a home invasion. John goes on a personal vendetta against the man behind the incident who is revealed to be Luc Deveraux, the eponymous Universal Soldier from the first two films who has now become a powerful terrorist military leader.
Though Day of Reckoning received generally mixed reviews, with criticisms toward its "brutal" violence, the film received praise for its direction, action, and "haunting" atmosphere; comparisons were made with the works of Michael Haneke and David Lynch. Day of Reckoning was first released on VOD in the United States before receiving a theatrical release on November 30, 2012. The film grossed $1.4 million against a production budget of $8 million.
