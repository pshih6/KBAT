Al St. John (September 10, 1892 – January 21, 1963) was an early American film comedian, and nephew of Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle, with whom he often appeared. He was employed by Mack Sennett and worked with many leading players such as Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Mabel Normand. In the talkies, he played the scruffy comedy relief character "Fuzzy Q. Jones" who appeared in dozens of films, including the Producers Releasing Corporation's "Billy the Kid" series from 1940 to 1946, and their "Lone Rider" series from 1941 to 1943.
