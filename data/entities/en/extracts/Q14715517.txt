The Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) is one of the graduate schools of Harvard University and one of the top schools of education in the United States. It was founded in 1920, when it was the first school to establish the EdD degree. Led by Dean Bridget Terry Long, the mission of HGSE is to prepare leaders in education and to generate knowledge to improve student opportunity, achievement, and success. It seeks to accomplish this mission by operating at the nexus of practice, policy, and research.
HGSE offers two doctoral programs: the Doctor of Philosophy in Education (PhD) and the Doctor of Education Leadership (EdLD). The PhD program replaced the EdD program, which enrolled its final cohort of students in fall 2013. HGSE also offers thirteen master's programs.
It is associated with the Harvard Education Publishing Group whose imprint is the Harvard Education Press and publishes the Harvard Educational Review. The Monroe C. Gutman Library is the school's primary library and one of its four main buildings.
