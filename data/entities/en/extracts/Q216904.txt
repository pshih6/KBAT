Aleksis Kivi (pronunciation ), born Alexis Stenvall, (10 October 1834 – 31 December 1872) was a Finnish author who wrote the first significant novel in the Finnish language, Seitsemän veljestä ("Seven Brothers") in 1870. Although Kivi was among the very earliest authors of prose and lyrics in Finnish, he is still considered one of the greatest.
