Do It Again is a 2010 documentary film directed by Robert Patton-Spruill and produced by Boston Globe reporter Geoff Edgers. The film follows Edgers on his quest to reunite British rock band The Kinks. Along the way he interviews several musicians and celebrities (including Sting, Zooey Deschanel, and Clive Davis), discussing with them the band's music and influence, as well as their sentiments towards a potential Kinks reunion. Shooting for Do It Again began in the spring of 2008, and it made its debut at the Rotterdam International Film Festival in January 2010. Do It Again showed at several film festivals around the world throughout 2010, and was picked up for broadcast on public television in late 2011.
