Irmgard Keun (6 February 1905 – 5 May 1982) was a German novelist. She is noted for her portrayals of the life of women and is “...often reduced to the bold sexuality of her writing, Keun was a significant author of the late Weimar period and die Neue Sachlichkeit." She was born into an affluent family and was given the autonomy to explore her passions. After her attempts at acting ended at the age of 16, Keun began working as a writer after years of working in Hamburg and Greifswald. Her books were banned by Nazi authorities but gained recognition during the final years of her life.
