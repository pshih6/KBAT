Mohamed Waheed Hassan Manik (Dhivehi: ޑރ. މުޙައްމަދު ވަޙީދު ޙަސަން މަނިކު; Arabic: مُحَمَّد وَحِيد حَسَن مَانِيك; born 3 January 1953) was the 5th President of the Maldives from 7 February 2012 to 17 November 2013, having succeeded to office following the disputed resignation of President Mohamed Nasheed, under whom Waheed had served as the Maldives' first Vice President in over half a century since 2008. He had previously worked as a news anchor, a United Nations official with UNICEF, UNDP and UNESCO, and a member of the Maldivian Parliament. Waheed was the first citizen of the Maldives to receive a Ph.D., having received it at Stanford University in the U.S., and reportedly the first person to appear on Maldivian Television.
On 7 February 2012, he assumed the office of president following the resignation of the incumbent, Mohamed Nasheed, which took place under circumstances which have not been fully clarified. Waheed is alleged to have collaborated with the opposition in order to force Nasheed's resignation. Waheed was the first Maldivian Vice President to have fully succeeded to presidency, and he was to serve for the remainder of the presidential term until November 2013.
During his short tenure in office he was one of the most unpopular presidents the Maldives has had. When he stood for re-election to a full 5-year term in the 2013 election, he was defeated by a wide margin and finished as the least voted of the four candidates running, having received only a little over 5% of the vote. The results of that election were later annulled, however, and a re-run was held, but Waheed chose not to stand for election again.
Having taken office at the age of 59 years, and having left it at the age of 60 years and ten months, he is to date the oldest person to have served as President of the Maldives.
