Pop rock (also typeset as pop/rock) is rock music with a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft, and less emphasis on attitude. Originating in the late 1950s as an alternative to normal rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and original style of rock and roll (and occasionally doo-wop).  It may be viewed as a distinct genre field, rather than music that overlaps with pop and rock.  The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than normal rock music.
