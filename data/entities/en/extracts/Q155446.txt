The Institut supérieur de l'aéronautique et de l'espace (ISAE-SUPAERO, English: National Higher French Institute of Aeronautics and Space), is one of the prestigious French universities (grandes écoles) in engineering founded in 1909. It was the world's first dedicated aerospace engineering school and is considered to be one of the best in Europe in that field. The school delivers a range of science and engineering degree programs. ISAE-SUPAERO is part of University of Toulouse, ISSAT, PEGASUS, GEA, Toulouse Tech, CESAER and Aerospace Valley.
Historically ISAE-SUPAERO results from the merger between SUPAERO and ENSICA in the summer of 2007. The aim of this move was to increase the international visibility of SUPAERO and the ENSICA (both of which depend from the French Ministry of Defense), by sharing their faculty and experimental means.
Since its founding in 1909 ISAE-SUPAERO has produced more than 21,500 graduates; some of them have achieved fame in their field, including: Henri Coandă, the discoverer of the Coanda effect; Henri Ziegler, father of the Airbus program; Frédéric d'Allest, first chairman of Arianespace; and Jean-François Clervoy (class of 1983), astronaut.
