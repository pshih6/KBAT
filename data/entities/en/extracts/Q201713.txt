The Last of Mrs. Cheyney is a 1937 American comedy-drama film adapted from the 1925 play of the same name, written by Frederick Lonsdale. The film tells the story of a chic jewel thief in England, who falls in love with one of her marks. 
The movie stars Joan Crawford, William Powell, Robert Montgomery and Frank Morgan. When director Richard Boleslawski died suddenly in the middle of production, George Fitzmaurice took over, and when he became ill, the film was finally completed by Dorothy Arzner. Both Fitzmaurice and Arzner were uncredited.
Two other versions of the film were made, one in 1929 with the same title, starring Norma Shearer, and another in 1951, as The Law and the Lady, starring Greer Garson.
