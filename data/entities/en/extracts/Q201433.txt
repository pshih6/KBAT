Dorothy Coade Hewett  (21 May 1923 â€“ 25 August 2002) was an Australian feminist poet, novelist and playwright. She has been called "one of Australia's best-loved and most respected writers". She was also a member of the Communist Party for a period, though she clashed on many occasions with the party leadership. In recognition of her 20 volumes of published literature, she received the Order of Australia, has a Writer's Walk plaque at Circular Quay, and a street named for her in Canberra. The Dorothy Hewett Award for an unpublished manuscript was established in 2015 by UWA Publishing. She was a recipient of the Christopher Brennan Award.
