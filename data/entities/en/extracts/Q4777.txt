Mount Roraima (Spanish: Monte Roraima; Tepuy Roraima Portuguese: Monte Roraima [ˈmõtʃi ʁoˈɾajmɐ], and Cerro Roraima;) is the highest of the Pakaraima chain of tepuis (table-top mountain) or plateaus in South America.:156 First described to Europeans by the English explorer Sir Walter Raleigh during his 1595 expedition, its 31-square-kilometre (12-square-mile) summit area:156 is bounded on all sides by cliffs rising 400 metres (1,300 ft). The mountain also serves as the tripoint of Venezuela, Guyana and Brazil.:156 Raleigh learned about it from indigenous peoples, who lived there before arrival of Europeans in the 15-1600's.
Mount Roraima lies on the Guiana Shield in the southeastern corner of Venezuela's 30,000-square-kilometre (12,000-square-mile) Canaima National Park forming the highest peak of Guyana's Highland Range. 
The highest point in Guyana and the highest point of the Brazilian state of Roraima lie on the plateau, but Venezuela and Brazil have higher mountains elsewhere. The triple border point is at 5°12′08″N 60°44′07″W, but the mountain's highest point is Laberintos del Norte.
The 85% of this tepui is in Venezuelan territory (Bolívar state), 10% in the territory of Guyana. (Cuyuni-Mazaruni, Zone also claimed by Venezuela),  and 5% belongs to the state of Roraima in Brazil.
