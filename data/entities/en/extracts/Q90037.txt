Kurt Heinrich Debus (November 29, 1908 â€“ October 10, 1983) was a German V-2 rocket scientist and ex-SS member for Nazi Germany who, after being brought to the United States under Operation Paperclip, in 1962 became the first director of NASA's Launch Operations Center (later the Kennedy Space Center).
Debus directed the design, development, construction and operation of NASA's Saturn launch facilities at the north end of Cape Canaveral and adjacent Merritt Island in Florida. Under him, NASA conducted 150 launches of military missiles and space vehicles, including 13 Saturn V rockets, the booster for the Apollo manned moon landings.
