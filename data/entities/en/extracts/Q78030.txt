Walter Franz Maria Stennes (12 April 1895 â€“ 19 May 1983) was a leader of the Sturmabteilung (SA, stormtroopers, or "brownshirts") of the Nazi Party in Berlin and the surrounding area.  In August 1930 he led the Stennes Revolt against Adolf Hitler, the leader of the party, and Hitler's appointed regional head of the party in the Berlin area, Joseph Goebbels. The dispute was over Hitler's policies and practices in the use of the SA, and the underlying purpose of the paramilitary organization.  Hitler quelled the revolt peacefully, but after a second rebellion in March-April 1931, the SA was purged and Stennes was expelled from the party.
