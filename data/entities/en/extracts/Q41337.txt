Uruch Beg, later known by his baptized name of Don Juan (1560â€“1604) was a late 16th and early 17th century Iranian figure in Iran and Spain. He is also known as Faisal Nazary. A native of Iran, and from the Bayat Qizilbash clan, he later moved westward, settled in Spain, and became a Roman Catholic. There he wrote an account of Iran, his involvement there with Shah Abbas I, and his journey to Spain in the Persian embassy to Europe (1599-1602). He was killed in 1604 during a street fight.
Don Juan was the son of Sultan Ali Beg, who was the brother of the Iranian ambassador Husain Ali Beg.
