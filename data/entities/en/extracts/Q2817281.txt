The Zosimaia School (Greek: Ζωσιμαία Σχολή, Zosimaía Scholí) of Ioannina (in Epirus) has been one of the most significant Greek middle-level educational institutions (high schools) during the last period of Ottoman rule in the region (1828–1913). The Zosimaia was founded at 1828 through the personal expense of the Zosimas brothers, and is still functioning as a high school under the regulations of the Greek Ministry of Education.
