Víctor Manuel Ruiz Velázquez (born September 27, 1968), known professionally as Víctor Manuelle, is a successful Latin Grammy nominated American salsa singer, known to his fans as El Sonero de la Juventud ("The Singer Of Youths").  He is identified primarily with salsa romantica or "salsa monga". Victor Manuel has neither recorded in English, nor made a Latin pop album, nor (with rare exceptions) ventured into acting, preferring to remain a musician grounded within salsa music. He recently surpassed Marc Anthony for the most number-one singles in the Billboard Tropical Songs chart.
