Gareth Richard Vaughan Jones (13 August 1905 – 12 August 1935) was a Welsh journalist who first reported in the Western world, without equivocation and under his own name, the existence of the Soviet famine of 1932–33, including the Holodomor. Earlier reports by Malcolm Muggeridge, writing as an anonymous correspondent, had appeared in the Manchester Guardian.
