The Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP, Finnish: Suomen sosialidemokraattinen puolue, Swedish: Finlands socialdemokratiska parti), shortened to the Social Democrats and commonly known in Finnish as Demarit, is a social-democratic political party in Finland. The party is the largest party in Finland's parliament with 40 seats. The party has set many fundamental policies of Finnish society during its representation in the Finnish Government. Founded in 1899, the SDP is Finland's oldest active political party. The SDP has a close relationship with Finland's largest trade union confederation, SAK, and is a member of the Socialist International, the Party of European Socialists, and SAMAK.
Following the resignation of Antti Rinne in December 2019, Sanna Marin became the country's 67th Prime Minister. SDP formed a new coalition government on the basis of its predecessor, in effect continuing cooperation with the Centre Party, the Green League, the Left Alliance, and the Swedish People's Party. Seven of the government's nineteen ministers are Social Democrats.
