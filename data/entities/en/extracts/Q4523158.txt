Sherlock Holmes (Russian: Шерлок Холмс, tr. Sherlok Kholms) is a Russian television crime drama series based on the Sherlock Holmes detective stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, and was aired in November 2013. Some of the stories have never been adapted before. It stars Igor Petrenko as Sherlock Holmes and Andrei Panin as Doctor John Watson. Eight episodes have been produced, while the first episode was aired in late 2013.
This is the last film role of Andrei Panin, who died before he was able to complete the dubbing of his lines as Dr. Watson. However, they were able to finish the film almost entirely using the sound recorded on set, with only a small contribution by another voice actor.
