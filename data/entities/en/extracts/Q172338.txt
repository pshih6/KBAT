Dave Morgan (7 August 1944 in Cranmore, Somerset – 6 November 2018 in Leatherhead, Surrey) was a British racing driver from England. He participated in one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix, the 1975 British Grand Prix in which, like several others, he crashed during a storm in the closing laps.  He was classified 18th and thus scored no championship points.
Prior to his single grand prix entry, Morgan raced a Mini in the mid-1960s, and soon moved on to Formula Three. He incurred a 12-month ban for dangerous driving at the end of 1970, after a last corner collision with James Hunt at Crystal Palace, but was subsequently allowed to progress to Formula Atlantic in 1971. This was followed by two seasons in Formula Two, then a return to Formula Atlantic. After his one Grand Prix, he retired from racing until returning in the RAC Tricentrol Series in 1980–1981, driving a Colt Lancer. Morgan also later worked as an engineer to Eric van de Poele, in both Formula One and Formula 3000.He died on 6 November 2018, following a stroke.
