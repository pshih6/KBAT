Brycheiniog was an independent kingdom in South Wales in the Early Middle Ages. It often acted as a buffer state between England to the east and the powerful south Welsh kingdom of Deheubarth to the west. It was conquered and pacified by the Normans between 1088 and 1095, though it remained Welsh in character. It was transformed into the Lordship of Brecknock and later formed the southern and larger part of the historic county of Brecknockshire. To its south was the Kingdom of Morgannwg.
The main legacy of the kingdom of Brycheiniog is etymological. It has lent its name to Brecknockshire (Welsh: Sir Frycheiniog, the shire of Brycheiniog) and Brecon (known as Aberhonddu in Welsh).
