Claude Cahun (25 October 1894 â€“ 8 December 1954), born Lucy Renee Mathilde Schwob, was a French photographer, sculptor and writer.Schwob adopted the gender-ambiguous name Claude Cahun in 1917 and is best known for self-portraits, in which they assumed a variety of personae.
Cahun's work was both political and personal, and often undermined traditional concepts of static gender roles. In their autobiography, Disavowals, they explained, "Masculine? Feminine? It depends on the situation. Neuter is the only gender that always suits me."During WWII, Cahun was also active as a resistance worker and propagandist.
