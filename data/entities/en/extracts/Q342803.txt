Portsmouth is an independent city in the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 95,535. It is part of the Hampton Roads metropolitan area.
The Norfolk Naval Shipyard, often called the Norfolk Navy Yard, is a historic and active U.S. Navy facility that is located in Portsmouth. The shipyard's original name, Gosport, was changed to reflect its location in what once had been Norfolk County, Virginia. It constructs, refits and remodels ships of the US Navy, and is one of the few facilities in the world with a dry dock large enough to accommodate an aircraft carrier.
Both Norfolk and the city of Portsmouth have miles of waterfront land on opposite sides of the Elizabeth River as part of the harbor of Hampton Roads. Its three Elizabeth River ferries transport pedestrians between the Portsmouth Olde Towne Historic District and downtown Norfolk.
