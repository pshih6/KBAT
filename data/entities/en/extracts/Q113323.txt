Salomon Wininger (13 December 1877, Gura Humorului, Bukovina â€“ December 1968, in Ramat Gan, Israel) was an Austrian-Jewish biographer.
Before World War I, Wininger lived in Chernivtsi and moved to Vienna during the war years, where he decided to write biographies of famous Jews. This idea was pushed in order to counter the self-hating mood of Jewish youth in the city, created under the influence of Otto Weininger's works.
After his return to Chernivtsi in 1921, Shlomo Wininger wrote about 13,000 biographies and published them in seven volumes between 1925 and 1936. He survived the time of World War II in Chernivtsi and emigrated in 1951 to Israel.
Wininger is considered as one of the greatest Jewish biographers of all time.
