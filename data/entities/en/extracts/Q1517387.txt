Vvedenskoye Cemetery (Russian: Введенское кладбище, IPA: [vʲːɪˈdʲenskəjə])  is a historic cemetery in the Lefortovo District of Moscow in Russia.
Until 1918 it was mainly a burial ground for the Catholic and Protestant communities of the city, principally ethnic Germans, and thus it was also called the German Cemetery (Russian: Немецкое кладбище). After 1918 the cemetery was secularized and accepted the dead of all confessions, including the Orthodox clergy. Throughout its history it has also been extensively used as a military cemetery. It is located on a 20 hectare lot between Gospitalny Val Street and Nalichnaya Street at 55°46′8″N 37°42′25″E.
