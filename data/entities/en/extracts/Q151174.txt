Darwin Airline SA was a Swiss regional airline with its head office in Bioggio, Lugano flying under the brand name Adria Airways Switzerland. It operated scheduled domestic and international services in some western European countries.  It used the brand name Etihad Regional from January 2014 to July 2017,  when Etihad Airways sold its 33% stake to the owner of Adria Airways. It previously also operated flights on behalf of Alitalia. Its bases were Geneva Airport and Lugano Airport.In November 2017, the Swiss authorities suspended the airline's license for scheduled flights due to financial difficulties but allowed the wetlease operations to be continued. On 12 December 2017, the airline was declared bankrupt and ceased all remaining operations after its license was voided, while some of their fleet was transferred to its owner Adria Airways; the Saab 2000 aircraft still operate scheduled services from Ljubljana Airport in the name of Adria Airways, with the aircraft still carrying the Adria Airways Switzerland livery.
