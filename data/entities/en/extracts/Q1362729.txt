The Technical University of Lisbon (UTL; Portuguese: Universidade Técnica de Lisboa, pronounced [univɨɾsiˈðad(ɨ) ˈtɛknikɐ ðɨ liʒˈbo.ɐ]) was a Portuguese public university. It was created in 1930 in Lisbon, as a confederation of preexisting schools, and comprised the faculties and institutes of veterinary medicine; agricultural sciences; economics and business administration; engineering, social and political sciences; architecture; and human kinetics.
On July 25, 2013, it merged with the older University of Lisbon (1911–2013) and was incorporated in the new University of Lisbon.
