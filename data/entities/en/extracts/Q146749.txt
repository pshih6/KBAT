Daniel Schneidermann is a French journalist, born in Paris on April 5, 1958, who focuses on the analysis of televised media.  He is mainly active in weekly columns—in the past in Le Monde and presently in Libération and on a video channel:  Arrêt sur images (Freeze-frame), formerly broadcast by the public TV channel France 5, but currently financed by subscription. The television show was canceled in 2007 by France 5 direction, an incident that led to the creation of the Arret Sur Images web site.
