Thomas Russell Crampton, MICE, MIMechE (6 August 1816 â€“ 19 April 1888) was an English engineer born at Broadstairs, Kent, and trained on Brunel's Great Western Railway.
He is best known for designing the Crampton locomotive but had many engineering interests including the electric telegraph and the Channel Tunnel for which he designed a boring machine. His locomotives had much better success in France, Germany and Italy than they did in the UK.
