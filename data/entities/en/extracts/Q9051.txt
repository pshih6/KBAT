Luxembourgish, Luxemburgish ( LUK-səm-bur-gish), Letzeburgesch ( LETS(-ə)-bur-GESH or  LETS(-ə)-bur-gish) (Luxembourgish: Lëtzebuergesch), or Luxembourgian is a West Germanic language that is spoken mainly in Luxembourg. About 390,000 people speak Luxembourgish worldwide.As a standard form of the Moselle Franconian language, Luxembourgish has similarities with other varieties of High German and the wider group of West Germanic languages. The status of Luxembourgish as an official language in Luxembourg and the existence there of a regulatory body, has removed Luxembourgish, at least in part, from the domain of Standard German, its traditional Dachsprache.
