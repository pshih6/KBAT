Bullets Don't Argue (Italian: Le pistole non discutono, also known as Guns Don't Talk and Pistols Don't Argue) is a 1964 Italian Spaghetti Western film directed by Mario Caiano. The film was  produced by Jolly Film back to back with Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars, but with a more expensive budget and in anticipation of a greater success than the Leone's film, especially because at the time Rod Cameron was better known than Clint Eastwood.
