Michael Jackson's Thriller is a 1983 music video for the Michael Jackson song "Thriller", directed by John Landis and written by Landis and Jackson. It references numerous horror films, and stars Jackson performing a dance routine with a horde of the undead. Ola Ray co-stars as Jackson's girlfriend.
Jackson contacted Landis after seeing his film An American Werewolf in London (1981). The pair conceived a short film with a budget much larger than previous music videos. It was filmed at the Palace Theatre in Downtown Los Angeles, the junction of Union Pacific Avenue and South Calzona Street in East Los Angeles, and the Angeleno Heights neighborhood at 1345 Carroll Avenue. A making-of documentary, Making Michael Jackson's Thriller, was also produced to receive financing from television networks.
Michael Jackson's Thriller was launched to great anticipation and played regularly on MTV. It doubled the sales of the Thriller album, helping it become the bestselling album in history, and sold over a million copies on VHS, becoming the bestselling videotape at the time. It is credited for transforming music videos into a serious art form, breaking down racial barriers in popular entertainment, and popularizing the making-of documentary. The success transformed Jackson into a dominant force in global pop culture.Many elements of Michael Jackson's Thriller have had a lasting impact on popular culture, such as the zombie dance and Jackson's red jacket, designed by Landis's wife Deborah Nadoolman. Fans worldwide re-enact its zombie dance and it remains popular on YouTube. The Library of Congress described it as "the most famous music video of all time", and it has been named the greatest video of all time by various publications and readers' polls. In 2009, it became the first music video inducted into the National Film Registry as "culturally, historically or aesthetically" significant.
