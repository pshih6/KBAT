Ellen Browning Scripps (October 18, 1836 â€“ August 3, 1932) was an American journalist and philanthropist who was the founding donor of several major institutions in Southern California. She and her brother E.W. Scripps created America's largest chain of newspapers, linking Midwestern industrial cities with booming towns in the West. By the 1920s, Ellen Browning Scripps was worth an estimated $30 million (or $3.5 billion in 2016 dollars), most of which she gave away. 
In 1924, she founded the Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, CA. She appeared on the cover of Time magazine after founding Scripps College in Claremont, California.  She also donated millions of dollars to organizations worldwide that promised to advance democratic principles and women's education. She never married.
