Dr. Ernst Ziehm (1 May 1867 – 7 July 1962) was a Danzig-based German politician from the conservative German National People's Party and President of the Senate of the Free City of Danzig from 1931 to 1933. Born in Damerau, West Prussia, Ziehm studied jurisprudence and judicial Intern in Strasbourg and Marienweder from 1905 to 1914. Then he became judicial official in Oppeln. In 1914, he became an administrator in Danzig. From 1931 to 1933 he served as President of the Senate of the Free City of Danzig (Head of State). After 1933, he was replaced by Hermann Rauschning, as Nazis seized control over the city-state's government. Ziehm died in Lübeck in 1962.
