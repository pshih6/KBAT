William Jason "Jay" Reso (born November 30, 1973) is a Canadian actor and retired professional wrestler, best known for his time with WWE under the ring name Christian, a shortened version of his original ring name Christian Cage that was also used during his tenure in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Reso was trained by Ron Hutchison and Dory Funk Jr. and made his professional wrestling debut in June 1995.
Reso wrestled in Canadian independent promotions early in his career, where he frequently competed in singles and tag team competition with longtime best friend Adam Copeland. In 1998, Reso signed a developmental deal with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and was rebranded as the storyline brother of Edge, Copeland's WWF persona. Reso made his debut the following year and immediately captured his first title in the company, the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship. Edge and Christian gained notoriety as a tag team for their participation in Tables, Ladders and Chairs matches and winning the WWF Tag Team Championship on seven different occasions. The team parted ways in 2001, after which Reso held various singles titles, including the European Championship, the Hardcore Championship, and the Intercontinental Championship.
In November 2005, Reso signed with TNA under his Christian Cage ring name, where he won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship twice. Reso left TNA in late 2008 and re-signed with WWE, where he won the ECW Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship twice each. He is the twenty-third Triple Crown Champion and the eleventh Grand Slam Champion in WWE history.
