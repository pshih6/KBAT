Christopher Andersen Hornsrud (15 November 1859 – 12 December 1960) was a Norwegian politician for the Labour Party. He served as leader of the Labour Party from 1903 to 1906 and became a member of the Storting in 1912. In 1928, he became the first Norwegian Prime Minister from the Labour Party, but the cabinet had a weak parliamentary basis and was only in office for three weeks from January to February. He combined the post of Prime Minister with that of Minister of Finance. After resigning he became Vice-President of the Storting, a position he held to 1934.
Hornsrud was born in Skotselv, Øvre Eiker, and died in Oslo.
