Antoine-Frédéric Ozanam (pronounced [ɑ̃.twan.fʁe.de.ʁik o.za.nam]; April 23, 1813 – September 8, 1853) was a French literary scholar, lawyer, journalist and equal rights advocate. He founded with fellow students the Conference of Charity, later known as the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris in 1997, hence he may be properly called Blessed Frederic by Catholics. His feast day is September 9.
