KYPCK (Volapuk rendition from rus. Курск, Kursk in the Western Alphabet) is a Finnish metal band. They were formed in 2007 and sing in Russian.
The band's vocalist Erkki Seppänen speaks fluent Russian after his years at Oxford University and working in the embassy in Moscow. The other members of the band are ex-Sentenced members Sami Lopakka (guitar) and Sami Kukkohovi, bassist Jaakko Ylä-Rautio and drummer Antti Karihtala. KYPCK's debut album "Черно" (Cherno, Black) was released in 2008, their second album "Ниже" (Nizhe, Lower) in 2011, and their third "Имена на стене" (Imena na Stene, The Names on the Wall) in 2014. The band's fourth album Зеро (Zero) was released on 16.09.2016.
The experienced outfit is something out of the ordinary on stage, as well. KYPCK's live performances have been distinctive from the very beginning, including Soviet Era video projections and peculiar instruments like bassist Ylä-Rautio's 1-stringed bass Kypcklop, and guitarist Lopakka's 6-stringer, built by Amfisound Guitars, around a genuine Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle.KYPCK have created their own genre Doomsday Metal and broken numerous barriers on their way: The first album sang entirely in the Russian language to have been released worldwide. The lengthiest Russian tour ever by a Western band - from St. Petersburg to Siberia's Irkutsk. Songs on the playlist of Russia's biggest rock radio station, who have strictly ruled out including non-Russian bands in their playlist rotation. In 2015, the band was banned from entering Belarus. On February 4, 2018, the band is playing a concert in Minsk, Belarus. https://afisha.tut.by/concert/kypck-finlyandiya/
