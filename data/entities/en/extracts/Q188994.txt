Drum and bass (also written as "drum 'n' bass"; commonly abbreviated as "D&B", "DnB" or "D'n'B") is a genre of electronic music characterised by fast breakbeats (typically 160â€“180 beats per minute) with heavy bass and sub-bass lines, sampled sources, and synthesizers. The music grew out of breakbeat hardcore (and its derivatives of darkcore, and hardcore jungle).  The popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other homegrown dance styles in the UK. A major influence was the original Jamaican dub and reggae sound. Another feature of the style is the complex syncopation of the drum tracks' breakbeat.Drum and bass subgenres include breakcore, ragga jungle, hardstep, darkstep, techstep, neurofunk, ambient drum and bass, liquid funk (aka liquid drum and bass), jump up, drumfunk, funkstep, sambass, and drill 'n' bass. From its roots in the UK, the style has established itself around the world. Drum and bass has influenced many other genres like hip hop, big beat, dubstep, house, trip hop, ambient music, techno, jazz, rock and pop. Drum and bass is dominated by a relatively small group of record labels. Major international music labels had shown very little interest in the drum and bass scene until BMG Rights Management acquired RAM in February 2016. Drum and bass remains most popular in the UK, although it has developed scenes all around the world.
