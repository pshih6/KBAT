Magnus Jacob Crusenstolpe (1795â€“1865), Swedish historian; he became famous both as a political and a historical writer early in his career.
Crusenstolpe won considerable distinction with a series of historical-romantic tales, (Little Stories); but his fame rests mainly on his works as a journalist, historian, biographer, and politician. His works of fiction become to a degree political or progressive (see for example The House of Holstein-Gottorp in Sweden).
