The Hungarian Democratic Forum (Hungarian: Magyar Demokrata Fórum, MDF) was a centre-right political party in Hungary. It had a Hungarian nationalist, national-conservative, Christian-democratic ideology. The party was represented continuously in the National Assembly from the restoration of democracy in 1990 until 2010. It was dissolved on 8 April 2011.
The MDF was the largest party on Hungary's emergence as a democratic country under the leadership of József Antall, Prime Minister between 1990 and 1993.  Since then, its representation has receded, with the party playing the role of junior coalition partner to Fidesz from 1998 to 2002, and in opposition otherwise.
It was a member of the Centrist Democrat International and was a member of the European People's Party until 2009, when it joined the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists.  The MDF's one MEP, Lajos Bokros, sat with the European Conservatives and Reformists in the European Parliament.
