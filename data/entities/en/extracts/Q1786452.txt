Merlin's Apprentice (sometimes called Merlin's Apprentice: The Search for the Holy Grail) is a 2006 miniseries. It is a sequel to the hit 1998 television miniseries Merlin with Sam Neill and Miranda Richardson reprising their roles as Merlin and the Lady of the Lake, albeit slightly different versions of their characters.
While being vaguely based on Arthurian legend, its plot is set after the death of King Arthur and completely different from the traditional legends.
