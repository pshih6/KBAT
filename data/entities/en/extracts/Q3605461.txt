Adolfo Orsi (23 March 1888 â€“ 20 December 1972) was an Italian industrialist, known for owning the Maserati automobile maker.
Born within a poor family in Sant'Agnese, near Modena, Orsi lost his father in 1899 - an event that forced him to start working at a very young age. In the late 1920s he started his own business as scrap iron, steel mill and farm equipment manufacturer, eventually employing hundreds of people from Modena and the surrounding area. Orsi soon started pursuing interests outside of the company, including running the trolley company of Modena, and being involved with the local soccer team, Modena F.C. in its successful early years. With his brother, Marcello, he was also involved in a Fiat dealership, the Fiat A.M. Orsi (1935).
