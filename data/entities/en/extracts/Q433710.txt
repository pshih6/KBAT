Taylor Cameron Carpenter (born 1981) is an American organist. In 2009, he became the first organist to ever be nominated for a Grammy Award for his solo album, Revolutionary. He designed and commissioned the International Touring Organ (ITO), a one-of-a-kind, customized, “full-scale portable organ sonically tailorable to any acoustic environment”, which took ten years and cost $2 million to build. Since its premiere in March 2014, he no longer has to learn a new instrument for every performance which he characterized as maddening, and he now tours worldwide to venues that have never had an organ. The story of the ITO is the subject of the 2015 documentary "The Sound of My Life".
