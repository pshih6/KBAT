Adam Silver (born April 25, 1962) is an American businessman, lawyer and sports executive who is the fifth and current commissioner of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He joined the NBA in 1992 and has held various positions within the league, becoming chief operating officer and deputy commissioner under his predecessor and mentor David Stern in 2006.  When Stern retired in 2014, Silver was named the new commissioner.
While commissioner, the league continued to grow economically and globally, especially in China. Silver made headlines in 2014 for forcing Donald Sterling to sell the Los Angeles Clippers after Sterling made racist remarks; later banning him for life from the game. Silver also received international attention for his neutral positioning of NBA during the 2019 Hong Kong protests.
