Puni Puni Poemy (ぷにぷに☆ぽえみぃ, Puni Puni ☆ Poemii) is a Japanese two-part original video animation spin-off from the Excel Saga manga and anime television series It features some of that series' secondary characters and many of its staff, primarily director Shinichi Watanabe. Like Excel Saga, it is a parody of other anime, manga and various aspects of popular culture, though in this case with the magical girl genre providing its primary focus and general structure. The series was originally an in-joke from an episode of Excel Saga; Watanabe decided to take the in-joke to its most extreme logical conclusion, creating the series.
