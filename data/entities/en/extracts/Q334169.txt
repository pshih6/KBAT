Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III is a 1990 American slasher film directed by Jeff Burr. The film is the third installment of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series, and it stars Kate Hodge, William Butler, Ken Foree, Tom Hudson, Viggo Mortensen, Joe Unger, and R.A. Mihailoff as Leatherface. The film follows Leatherface and his cannibalistic family stalking a motorist couple in the backroads of Texas.
The film was distributed by New Line Cinema, who bought the rights to the series from The Cannon Group. Initially, this film was given an X-rating by the Motion Picture Association of America, which limited the studio's release possibilities. After the studio made cuts, it was re-rated R, and New Line released it on January 12, 1990. It was refused classification in the UK upon its initial release. It has since been released on home video in both unrated and rated versions, and a cut version was accepted with an 18 certificated in the UK.
The film was both a critical and commercial failure, grossing $5.7 million at the US box office, making it the poorest performing film in the series at the time, until the release of its successor, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1995).
