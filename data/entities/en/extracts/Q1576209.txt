Peter & the Wolf (Polish: Piotruś i wilk) is a short Polish-British-Norwegian-Mexican-Swiss stop-motion animated film released in 2006. Written and directed by Suzie Templeton and scenography by Marek Skrobecki, it was made in Se-ma-for Studios in Łódź and has been shown in cinemas, sometimes with live musical accompaniment.
The film is based on the story of Peter and the Wolf as set to the music Sergei Prokofiev in 1936. Unlike the usual version of Prokofiev's work, the film has no narrator but relies on music and images to tell the story. A new recording of Prokofiev's music was made to accompany the cinema and television release. The recording was made by the Philharmonia Orchestra and conducted by Mark Stephenson.
