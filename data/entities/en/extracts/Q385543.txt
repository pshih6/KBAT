The Communist Party of the Netherlands (Dutch: Communistische Partij Nederland, Dutch pronunciation: [kɔmyˈnɪstisə pɑrˈtɛi ˈneːdərlɑnt], CPN) was a Dutch communist party. The party was founded in 1909 as the Social-Democratic Party (SDP) and merged with the Pacifist Socialist Party, the Political Party of Radicals and the Evangelical People's Party in 1991, forming the centre-left GreenLeft. Members opposed to the merger founded the New Communist Party of the Netherlands.
