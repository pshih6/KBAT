Ottilie Wilhelmine Ernestine Henriette von Goethe (born Freiin von Pogwisch; 1796-1872) was a German socialite and the daughter-in-law of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
Her father, Wilhelm Julius Baron von Pogwisch (1760–1836), was of Holstein nobility, her mother, Henriette Ulrike Ottilie von Pogwisch (1776–1851), was born Countess Henckel von Donnersmarck. The parents divorced early and Ottilie lived with her mother in many different cities. She became a close friend for life of Adele Schopenhauer. Both were born in Danzig and grew up without father.
Otilie was interested in Ferdinand Heinke, who finally became engaged to a different woman. Therefore, Ottilie agreed to marry August von Goethe, the only child of the famous poet. They married on 17 June 1817 and moved to Weimar, where they lived in the poet's house at Frauenplan. The couple had three children: Walther Wolfgang von Goethe (1818–1885), Wolfgang Maximilian von Goethe (1820–1883) and Alma Sedina Henriette Cornelia von Goethe (1827–1844). The marriage was unhappy because August was a drinker and Ottilie was attracted to other men. Also, her father-in-law was a dominant figure in their life.
Ottilie von Goethe called her father-in-law 'father' and lived in his house for 15 years. The witty socialite attracted international guests and founded, in 1829, the journal Chaos. She also helped the famous writer finalizing his eminent play Faust II. August died in 1830 in Italy, and the old Goethe two years later.
In 1835, Otilie became the mother of a daughter, Anna Sibylla. The father was a British captain. Especially after this extramarital birth Ottilie suffered under enormous slander. According to malicious rumours she had even killed her eldest daughter Alma.
After Goethe's death she lived in several cities. Her last two years she stayed in Weimar. In 1872, she died because of a heart failure. Her grave lies in Goethe's family tomb.
