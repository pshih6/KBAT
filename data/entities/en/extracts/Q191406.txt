The Israel national football team (Hebrew: נבחרת ישראל בכדורגל‎, Nivḥeret Yisra'el BeChaduregel) represents Israel in international football, and is governed by the Israel Football Association (IFA).
Israel's national team is the direct successor of the Mandatory Palestine (Eretz Israel) national football team, which played five internationals in 1934–1940, and was managed by the Eretz Israel Football Association. Israel football is a part of the UEFA since 1994 as well.
The Israeli side qualified for their only FIFA World Cup to date in 1970.
