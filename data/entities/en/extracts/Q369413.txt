Mann (transl.â€‰Mind) is a 1999 Indian Hindi-language romantic drama film directed by Indra Kumar. The film stars popular actors Aamir Khan, Manisha Koirala and Anil Kapoor. Rani Mukerji also makes a special appearance in the movie. This is Aamir and Manisha's second movie together after Akele Hum Akele Tum. The film was remade in the same year in Telugu, titled Ravoyi Chandamama, starring Akkineni Nagarjuna, Anjala Zhaveri, Keerthi Reddy and Jagapati Babu.
The movie is loosely based on 1965 movie Bheegi Raat which itself was a remake of 1957 American movie An Affair to Remember which in turn was a remake of 1939 movie Love Affair. Both Aamir and Manisha's performances and chemistry were appreciated.  The film's climax was also praised.
