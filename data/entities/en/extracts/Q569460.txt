The Hochschule f端r Musik Hanns Eisler (Hanns Eisler College or Academy of Music) in Berlin, Germany, is one of the leading music conservatories in Europe. It was established in East Berlin in 1950 as the Deutsche Hochschule f端r Musik (German College of Music) because the older Hochschule f端r Musik Berlin (now the Berlin University of the Arts) was in West Berlin. After the death of one of its first professors, composer Hanns Eisler, the school was renamed in his honor in 1964. After a renovation in 2005 the conservatory is located in both Berlin's famed Gendarmenmarkt and the Neuer Marstall.
The Hochschule f端r Musik Hanns Eisler has a variety of ensembles including chamber music, choirs, orchestras and jazz.
