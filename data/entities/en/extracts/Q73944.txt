Two Tickets to Broadway is a 1951 American Technicolor musical film directed by James V. Kern and filmed on the RKO Forty Acres backlot. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound Recording (John O. Aalberg). The film was choreographed by Busby Berkeley.
The roles of the two delicatessen owners were originally offered to Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, who had to turn down the parts due to Laurel being ill. The comedy team of Smith and Dale got the roles instead.
