Charisma (カリスマ, Karisuma) is a 1999 Japanese philosophical drama film written and directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa, starring Kōji Yakusho.
The film is about a dispute between a number of people about a unique but possibly toxic tree growing in an unnamed forest. The film is largely seen from the point of view of Goro Yabuike (Kōji Yakusho), a police negotiator who has been relieved of his duties following his failure to prevent the death of an important hostage.  He stands in the middle of the conflicting opinions about the future of the tree, and has to decide which course to commit himself to.
