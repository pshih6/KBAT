Viktor Vladimirovich Yerofeyev (Russian: Ви́ктор Влади́мирович Ерофе́ев, also transliterated as Erofeyev; born September 19, 1947 in Moscow) is a Russian writer. As son of a high-ranking Soviet diplomat Vladimir Yerofeyev, he spent some of his childhood in Paris, which accounts for why much of his work has been translated from Russian into French, while comparatively little has been translated into English. His father, who was the interpreter for Molotov in the 1940s, wrote a book of memories; his brother is a curator at the Tretyakov Gallery.
