​8 1⁄2 (Italian title: Otto e mezzo, pronounced [ˈɔtto e ˈmɛddzo]) is a 1963 Italian surrealist comedy-drama film directed by Federico Fellini and co-scripted by Fellini, Tullio Pinelli, Ennio Flaiano, and Brunello Rondi. It stars Marcello Mastroianni as Guido Anselmi, a famous Italian film director who suffers from stifled creativity as he attempts to direct an epic science fiction film. It is shot in black and white by cinematographer Gianni Di Venanzo and features a soundtrack by Nino Rota, with costume and set designs by Piero Gherardi.
​8 1⁄2 won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Costume Design (black-and-white). It is acknowledged as an avant-garde film and a highly influential classic, and it was among the top 10 on BFI The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time, ranked third in a 2002 poll of film directors conducted by the British Film Institute. It is also listed on the Vatican's compilation of the 45 best films made before 1995, the 100th anniversary of cinema. It is now considered to be one of the greatest films of all time.
