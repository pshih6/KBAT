Hansi Burg (1898â€“1975) was an Austrian-born German stage and film actress.
She was born in Vienna as the daughter of Eugen Burg, a leading German actor. She took up professional acting in 1917, appearing mostly on the stage but also in several silent films.
Burg became known for her long-term relationship with the film star Hans Albers who she met while they were acting together. The Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels forced them to split up because she was Jewish, although they remained in secret contact. During the Second World War she lived in exile in Britain. She returned in 1945 and settled down to live with Albers again. Her father died in Theresienstadt concentration camp.
