Léon Rosenfeld (French: [ʁɔzɛnfɛld]; 14 August 1904 in Charleroi – 23 March 1974) was a Belgian physicist and Marxist. 
Rosenfeld was born into a secular Jewish family. He was a polyglot who knew eight or nine languages and was fluent in at least five of them.Rosenfeld obtained a PhD at the University of Liège in 1926, and he was a close collaborator of the physicist Niels Bohr. He did early work in quantum electrodynamics that predates by two decades the work by Dirac and Bergmann. Rosenfeld contributed to a wide range of physics fields, from statistical physics and quantum field theory to astrophysics.  Along with  Frederik Belinfante, he derived the Belinfante-Rosenfeld stress-energy tensor.  He also founded the journal Nuclear Physics and coined the term lepton.In 1933, Rosenfeld married Dr. Yvonne Cambresier, who was one of the first women to obtain a Physics Ph.D from a European university.  They had a daughter, Andrée Rosenfeld (1934–2008) and a son, Jean Rosenfeld.
