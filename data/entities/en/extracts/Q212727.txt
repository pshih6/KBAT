Riordan's first full-length novel was Big Red Tequila, which became the first book in the Tres Navarre series.

Since then, Riordan has written The Kane Chronicles trilogy and The Heroes of Olympus series. The Kane Chronicles (2010-2012) focused on Egyptian mythology; The Heroes of Olympus was the sequel to the Percy Jackson series.
