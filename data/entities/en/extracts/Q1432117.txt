He was also noted for proving the existence of neutrinos. The National Academy of Sciences called Crane "an extraordinary physicist". The University of Michigan called him "one of the most distinguished experimental physicists of the 20th century". Crane was a chairman of the department of physics
 and a professor of physics at the University of Michigan, a member of the National Academy of Sciences.During World War 2, he worked on radar at MIT and proximity fuses at the Carnegie Institution of Washington and the University of Michigan. He consulted for the National Defense Research Commission and the Office of Scientific Research and Development.From 1957 to 1960, Crane was President of the Midwestern Universities Research Association.
