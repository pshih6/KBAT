Pirmasens is an independent town in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, near the border with France.   It was famous for the manufacture of shoes. The surrounding rural district was called Landkreis Pirmasens from 1818 until 1997, when it was renamed to SÃ¼dwestpfalz.
Pirmasens can be easily mistaken with Primasens, of which means a first sense in Latin-derived languages (First sense in Latin would be "primus sensus").
