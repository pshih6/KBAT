Rap-A-Lot is a Hip Hop record label founded by James Prince in 1987. Sub-labels include Smoke-A-Lot. The label, with its most famous act The Geto Boys, put the South on the Hip Hop map. Since then, it has maintained its success and focus on Gangsta Rap and Southern Rap. 
Rap-A-Lot was first distributed by A&M for a short time with the release of Raheem's 1988 debut The Vigilante. The label was later distributed through the 1990s by EMI's Priority (1991–1994), Noo Trybe (1994-1998) and Virgin (1998–2002). During the rest of the 2000s, it was distributed by Asylum and then Fontana.
The Geto Boys were the label's first nationally popular act, while Devin the Dude, whom The New York Times called "a brilliant oddball with a spaced-out flow," and whose contract ended in 2008, was, for 15 years, the label's longest-running act. 
On August 22, 2013, Rap-A-Lot announced that it recently signed a distribution deal with RED. Artists currently on its roster include Z-Ro and Bun B among others.
