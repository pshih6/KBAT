Evgeny Markovich Shvidler (Russian: Евгений Маркович Швидлер, born 23 March 1964), also Eugene Shvidler, is a Russian-American billionaire oil businessman. Although not often referred to as one of that country's prominent business oligarchs, as he became a US citizen in 1994, he nevertheless made his fortune during the privatization of Russian industry, and maintains a close connection to fellow oligarch Roman Abramovich and his circle. In 2008 Shvidler and Ambramovich purchased three houses in Snowmass Village, Colorado totaling over $62 million dollars in real estate.
