The Honourable John Talbot (c. 1712 – 23 September 1756) was a British judge and Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1734 to 1756.  
Talbot was the third son of Charles Talbot, 1st Baron Talbot, and his wife Cecil Mathews, daughter of Charles Mathews of Castell-y-Mynach. His father served as Lord Chancellor from 1733 to 1737.Talbot was appointed Recorder of Brecon in 1734 and was also returned as Member of Parliament for Brecon, on the Tredegar interest, at the 1734 British general election.  In Parliament, he voted for the Government in all recorded divisions. On 13 December 1734 he was admitted at Lincoln's Inn and was called to the bar in 1737. On 30 May 1737, he married Henrietta Decker, the daughter of Sir Matthew Decker, 1st Baronet. 
In 1740 Talbot was appointed Puisne Justice of Chester for life, and was returned for Brecon at the ensuing by-election before being returned unopposed at the 1741 British general election. In 1742 he was on the court list for the ballot on members of the committee of inquiry into Walpole's Administration, to which he was one of the few Old Whigs elected. He left his post as Recorder in 1745.Talbot was returned again unopposed for Brecon at the 1747 British general election. His wife died in September 1747. In August 1748 he married Hon. Catherine Chetwynd, daughter of John Chetwynd, 2nd Viscount Chetwynd. After 1747, Talbot believed his seat at Brecon was no longer secure, and he suggested that the  Duke of Newcastle should find him a seat elsewhere. He was proposed instead for Ilchester where his successful return  cost £2,000, half of which was met from the government's secret service funds. In December 1755 he was appointed junior Lord of Trade, and was again returned at the ensuing by-election at Ilchester.Talbot died on 23 September 1756. His first marriage was childless, but by his second wife he had four sons:
