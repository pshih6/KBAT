Allan Jaffee (born Abraham Jaffee, March 13, 1921) is an American cartoonist. He is notable for his work in the satirical magazine Mad, including his trademark feature, the Mad Fold-in. As of 2019, Jaffee had been a regular contributor to the magazine for 64 years and is its longest-running contributor. However, he launched his website [1] at the end of that year, where he announced he had stopped working after Mad's December 2019 issue. Since their August 2019 issue, Mad has either been reprinting old Fold-ins, or had new ones by Johnny Sampson. In the half-century between April 1964 and April 2013, only one issue of Mad was published without containing new material by Jaffee. In a 2010 interview, Jaffee said, "Serious people my age are dead."In 2008, Jaffee was honored by the Reuben Awards as the Cartoonist of the Year. New Yorker cartoonist Arnold Roth said, "Al Jaffee is one of the great cartoonists of our time." Describing Jaffee, Peanuts creator Charles Schulz wrote, "Al can cartoon anything".
