Dr. Walter Klaus Köbel (born 20 March 1918 in Darmstadt, Germany) was a German politician.
Dr. Köbel was first elected as Mayor of Rüsselsheim in 1954 at the age of 36.  In October 1963 he entered Hessian State Parliament, as a member of the SPD, and held these positions until his sudden death on the 10 September 1965. 
Following his death, a newly built sports hall in Rüsselsheim, was named in his honour as the Walter-Köbel-Halle. But it was renamed on March 14, 2013, when due to an historical inquiry, his former involvement in national socialist ideology became generally known.
