Gökşin Sipahioğlu (28 December 1926 – 5 October 2011) was a Turkish photographer  and journalist who founded the Paris-based photo agency Sipa Press. He spent most of his life in Paris where the French media dubbed him "le Grand Turc". He also helped found the Kadiköy Sports Club, now best known for the Efes Pilsen basketball team.
He was the editor of the Istanbul Express and played an active role in the riot against non-Muslims of Turkey on 6 to 7 September 1955. In an interview conducted in 1991 regarding the 1955 riots he stated that; "The attacks of 6/7 September were certainly planned by the Special Operations Unit. It was an extremely premediated operation and it accomplished its objective. Let me ask you; wasn't it a extraordinarily successful action?".
