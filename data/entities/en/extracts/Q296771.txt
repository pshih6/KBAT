Saad El-Din Rafik Al-Hariri (Arabic: سعد الدين رفيق الحريري‎; born 18 April 1970) is a Lebanese politician who was the Prime Minister of Lebanon from 18 December 2016 to 21 January 2020. He was also the Prime Minister from 9 November 2009 to 13 June 2011. He is the second son of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, who was assassinated in 2005. Hariri has also been the leader of the Future Movement party since 2005. He is seen as "the strongest figurehead" of the March 14 Alliance. After three years living overseas, he returned to Lebanon on 8 August 2014 and was designated Prime Minister on 3 November 2016. Hariri's surprise announcement of an intent to resign, broadcast on 4 November 2017 on Saudi state TV, has widely been seen as part of the Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict in Lebanon, and triggered a dispute between Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. The resignation was later suspended, following President Michel Aoun's request to "put it on hold ahead of further consultations". On October 29, 2019, amid the 2019–20 Lebanese protests, Hariri announced his resignation, and that of his cabinet.
