Gostan, Constant, or Kostan Zarian (Armenian: Կոստան Զարեան, Shamakhi,February 2, 1885 – Yerevan, December 11, 1969) was an Armenian writer who produced short lyric poems, long narrative poems of an epic cast, manifestos, essays, travel impressions, criticism, and fiction. The genre in which he excelled, however, was the diary form with long autobiographical divagations, reminiscences and impressions of people and places, interspersed with literary, philosophical and historical meditations and polemics.
