David Andrew Platt (born 10 June 1966) is an English former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.
Born in Chadderton, Lancashire, Platt began his career as an apprentice at Manchester United only to later move to Crewe Alexandra where he began building a reputation as a goal-scoring midfielder. At the age of 22, he signed for Aston Villa where he gained the attention of the then England manager Bobby Robson, with whom he soon made his debut. At the 1990 FIFA World Cup, Platt increased his reputation by scoring goals with both head and feet, whilst displaying good technique, passing abilities, and high work rates. According to Rob Bagchi in The Guardian, Platt "seized Bryan Robson's role with riveting aplomb." His performances in the World Cup earned him a move to Serie A club Bari in 1991.
In 1992, Platt moved to Juventus, where he spent one season. Platt continued scoring goals for England, playing in Euro 92 and 96. Despite his efforts, England failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. In 1993, he moved to Sampdoria where he stayed for two seasons before he returned to England to join up with Arsenal. Platt played with the London club for three years, being part of the Arsenal side that won the Premier League and FA Cup Double of 1998. Platt went on to manage Sampdoria and  Nottingham Forest, as well as England's Under-21 team.
