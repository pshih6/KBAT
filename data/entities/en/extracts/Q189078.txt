Alvin Nathaniel Joiner (born September 18, 1974), better known by his stage name Xzibit (pronounced "Exhibit"), is an American rapper, actor and broadcaster.
Xzibit began his musical career after the release of his debut studio album At The Speed Of Life on October 15, 1996. The album generated both critical and commercial success, peaking at number 74 on the Billboard 200. It also contained the single "Paparazzi", which peaked at number 83 on the Billboard Hot 100. This success allowed Xzibit to secure a recording contract with Loud Records later that year.
Xzibit released his second album 40 Dayz & 40 Nightz on August 25, 1998, which peaked at number 53 on the Billboard 200. The album also contained the single "What U See Is What U Get", which peaked at #50 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album's success also caught attention from West Coast rapper Dr. Dre who acted as the executive producer on Xzibit's third album Restless which was released on December 12, 2000.
Restless debuted at number 14 on the Billboard 200, and was later certified platinum in the United States. The album also contained the singles "Front 2 Back", "X", and "Get Your Walk On". His follow-up album Man vs. Machine (2002) also enjoyed similar commercial success; it debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200, and was certified gold, while Weapons of Mass Destruction (2004) also became certified gold. After the release of Full Circle in 2006, Xzibit underwent a musical hiatus, not releasing any music until the release of his seventh studio album Napalm on October 9, 2012. However, shortly after the release of the album, Xzibit entered another period of hiatus, and has not released any further music to date.
Xzibit has also gained fame as an actor and television host, notably for his role as Shyne Johnson in the television series Empire, and as the host for the reality television series Pimp My Ride. He has also starred in the films Gridiron Gang (2006), The X-Files: I Want to Believe (2008), Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (2009) and Sun Dogs (2017).
