Carlo Riva (24 February 1922 – 10 April 2017) was an Italian motorboat designer and builder, famed for his luxurious runabouts.
The runabouts built by Italian builder Carlo Riva are considered by many to be premier European examples of the type.  The most famous Riva of all time was the Carlo Riva design called the Aquarama Special.
Riva's history dates back to 1842, when Pietro Riva began building boats at Sarnico, a small northern Italian town on the shores of Lago d’Iseo. By the 1930s the business was managed by Pietro's grandson, Serafino, and the company had become a leading manufacturer of small racing boats, many of which he raced himself.  At the same time it began building pleasure boats. In the 1950s Serafino's son Carlo transformed the business, and in due course the Riva brand became a worldwide legend sought out by screen stars, royalty and businessmen alike.  Famous customers included Brigitte Bardot, Sophia Loren, Peter Sellers and many more besides. A succession of owners have owned the company since Carlo Riva sold it in the early 1970s, and today the firm is owned by the Ferretti Group.
