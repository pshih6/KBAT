Renton is a city in King County, Washington, and a suburb of Seattle.  Situated 11 miles (18 km) southeast of downtown Seattle, Renton straddles the southeast shore of Lake Washington, at the mouth of the Cedar River.
After a long history as an important salmon fishing area for Native Americans, Renton was first settled by people of European descent in the 1860s, and its early economy was based on coal mining, clay production, and timber export. Today, Renton is best known as the final assembly point for the Boeing 737 family of commercial airplanes, but it is also home to a growing number of well known manufacturing, technology, and healthcare organizations, including Boeing Commercial Airplanes Division, Paccar, Kaiser Permanente, IKEA, Providence Health & Services, UW Medicine, and Wizards of the Coast. As of 2018, the population in Renton is 102,153, up from 90,927 at the 2010 census. Renton currently is the eighth-largest city in Washington and is the fourth largest in King County. Since 2008, the National Football League's Seattle Seahawks have had a training facility in Renton, the Virginia Mason Athletic Center (VMAC), which is the second-largest facility in the NFL at 200,000 square feet (19,000 m2).
