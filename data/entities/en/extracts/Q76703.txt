Anton Herman Gerard "Anthony" Fokker (6 April 1890 â€“ 23 December 1939) was a Dutch aviation pioneer and aircraft manufacturer. He is most famous for the fighter aircraft he produced in Germany during the First World War such as the Eindecker monoplanes,  the Dr.1 triplane and the D.VII biplane.
After the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany to produce airplanes, Fokker moved his business to the Netherlands. There, his company was responsible for a variety of successful aircraft including the Fokker trimotor, a successful passenger aircraft of the inter-war years. He died in New York in 1939. Later authors suggest he was personally charismatic but unscrupulous in business and a controversial character.
