Tarabya (Burmese: တရဖျား, pronounced [təɹəbjá] or [təjəpʰjá]; 22 December 1368 – c. 25 November 1400) was king of Ava for about seven months in 1400. He was the heir apparent from 1385 to 1400 during his father King Swa Saw Ke's reign. He was a senior commander in Ava's first three campaigns (1385−91) against Hanthawaddy Pegu in the Forty Years' War. He was assassinated seven months into his rule by his one-time tutor, Gov. Thihapate of Tagaung. The court executed the usurper, and gave the throne to Tarabya's half-brother Min Swe.
Tarabya is remembered as the Mintara (Burmese: မင်းတရား, IPA: [mɪ́ɴ təjá]) nat spirit in the Burmese official pantheon of nats.
