The Australian Academy of the Humanities was established by Royal Charter in 1969 to advance scholarship and public interest in the humanities in Australia. It operates as an independent not-for-profit organisation partly funded by the Australian government.
The Academy:

supports humanities research through conferences, grants and awards;
supports the diffusion of humanities research findings through publication subsidies and media promotion;
provides advice to government, industry, the media, and the community on matters concerning the humanities;
maintains collaborations with bodies concerned with national cultural prosperity; and
maintains relations and exchanges with international bodies.
