Maverick is an American entertainment company founded in 1992 by Madonna, Frederick DeMann, and Veronica "Ronnie" Dashev, and formerly owned and operated by Warner Music Group. It included a recording company (Maverick Records), a film production company (Maverick Films), book publishing, music publishing, a Latin record division (Maverick Musica), and a television production company. The first releases for the company were Madonna's 1992 coffee table publication Sex and her studio album Erotica, which were released simultaneously to great controversy.
DeMann was bought out of the company for a reported $20 million in 1998. Guy Oseary increased his stake in the company and took control as Chairman and CEO. Madonna and Dashev left in 2004 after a lawsuit between Maverick and Warner Music Group.
