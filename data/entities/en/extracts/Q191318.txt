Zenzl Mühsam (born Kreszentia Elfinger:  27 July 1884 – 10 March 1962) was a political activist who was involved, with her husband, Erich Mühsam, in the Munich Soviet ("workers' council") of 1919.Fifteen years later, after her husband had been murdered in the Oranienburg concentration camp near Berlin, she made her way to Moscow, hoping to arrange for the publication of her husband's political writings.   Eight months after her arrival, identified as a "Trotskyist spy" she was caught up in the political purges of the late 1930s and first arrested in April 1936.   She was unable to leave the Soviet Union for another eighteen years, spending much (though not all) of that time in prisons or labour camps.   She survived.
