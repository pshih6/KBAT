Elvin Ernesto Santos Ordóñez (born 18 January 1963 in Tegucigalpa) was Vice President of Honduras between 27 January 2006 and 18 November 2008, when he resigned to stand as a Liberal Party candidate for the Presidency in the 2009 elections. For the 2005 election the constitution was amended to create a single vice-president. (Hondurans previously elected three 'presidential designates' on a ticket along with the presidential candidate.) Although Santos served as Vice President under the presidency of Manuel Zelaya, he distanced himself from Zelaya since there were conflicts between the two politicians. He was also against the fourth ballot box referendum that Zelaya promoted.
