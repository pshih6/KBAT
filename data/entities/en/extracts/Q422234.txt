George James Snelus (1837 - 1906) was an English metallurgist, known to be the first to remove phosphorus from pig iron, by oxidizing it in a converter lined with basic refractory materials. Facing difficulties to perform a reliable and cheap lining, he delayed further improvements and failed to find a practical solution, which was finally found by Sidney Gilchrist Thomas.
Snelus was awarded of the Bessemer Gold Medal for his research on dephosphorization. He shared the financial benefits of the basic process patents with Sidney Gilchrist Thomas and Percy Carlyle Gilchrist.
