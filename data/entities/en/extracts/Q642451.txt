Walter Charles Langer (February 5, 1899 â€“ July 4, 1981) was an American psychoanalyst who was best known for preparing a psychological analysis of Adolf Hitler in 1943. Langer studied the field of psychoanalysis at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts where he also worked as a professor upon completion of his education. The field of psychoanalytics later led Langer to be employed by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) where in the year of 1943 he prepared a psychological analysis of Adolf Hitler. Within this analysis, Langer successfully predicted Hitler's suicide as the "most plausible outcome", as well as the possibility of a military coup against Hitler well before the assassination attempt of 1944. Following his psychological analysis and Hitler's death, Langer wrote a report surrounding the events of Adolf Hitler's life titled The Mind of Adolf Hitler: A Secret Wartime Report. This publication is Langer's most notable work; however, he has also produced writings such as Psychology and Human Living, A Psychological analysis of Adolf Hitler: His Life and Legend, and Dissecting the Hitler Mind.
