Pope Paschal I (Latin: Paschalis I; died 824) was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from 25 January 817 to his death in 824.
Paschal was a member of an aristocratic Roman family. Before his election to the papacy, he was abbot of St. Stephen's monastery, which served pilgrims. His pontificate notably established the practice of crowning the emperor in Rome when, in 823, Paschal crowned Lothair I. He rebuilt a number of churches in Rome, including three basilicas.
