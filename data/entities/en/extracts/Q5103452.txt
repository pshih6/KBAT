Choate Rosemary Hall (often known as Choate; ) is a private, co-educational, college-preparatory boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut, United States. It took its present name and began a co-educational system with the merger in 1971 of two single-sex schools: The Choate School for boys (founded in 1896 in Wallingford) and Rosemary Hall for girls (founded in 1890 in Wallingford, moved later to Greenwich). At the merger, the Wallingford campus was enlarged with a complex of modernist buildings on its eastern edge to accommodate the students from Rosemary Hall.
The school has educated generations of the upper-class New England establishment and the American political elite, and it has introduced many programs to diversify the student population, including the introduction of a free education for families whose income is $75,000 or less. It is a member of the Eight Schools Association, begun informally in 1973â€“74 and formalized in 2006, when former Choate headmaster Edward Shanahan was appointed its first president. It is also a member of the Ten Schools Admissions Organization.
