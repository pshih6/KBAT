Tank is the name of two British heavy metal bands, both of which stem from a band formed in 1980 by Algy Ward, a former member of The Damned. The original band is known as part of the new wave of British heavy metal movement. Tank was often compared to Mot√∂rhead as both bands, trios fronted by singing bassists, played a loose, almost punk-styled metal music with often colourful lyrics.
