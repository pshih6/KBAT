The Birthday Massacre (abbreviated TBM) is a Canadian rock band, formed in 1999 in London, Ontario, and currently based in Toronto, Ontario. The current lineup consists of lead vocalist Chibi, rhythm guitarist Rainbow, lead guitarist Falcore, keyboardist Owen, drummer Philip Elliot, and bassist Brett Carruthers.
When the band formed in 1999, they were known as Imagica. This name was inspired by the fantasy novel Imajica (1991) by Clive Barker. In 2002, they changed the name to The Birthday Massacre after one of their earlier songs in order to avoid confusion with another group. The song "The Birthday Massacre" was then renamed to "Happy Birthday". According to their vocalist Chibi: "it kind of works well for the music that we're making. Sort of contrasty, you know? Birthday, and massacre. Light, and dark. Cute, and evil".TBM have released seven studio albums: Nothing and Nowhere (2002), Violet (2005), Walking With Strangers (2007), Pins and Needles (2010), Hide and Seek (2012), Superstition (2014) and Under Your Spell (2017). Their eighth studio album, Diamonds, was released in March 2020.
They also issued the DVD Blue (2005), the live album/DVD Show and Tell (2009), the demo album Imagica, and the EPs Violet (2004), Looking Glass (2008), Imaginary Monsters (2011).
