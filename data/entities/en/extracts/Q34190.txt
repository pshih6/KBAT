Henry Fielding (22 April 1707 â€“ 8 October 1754) was an English novelist and dramatist known for his earthy humour and satire, and as the author of the comic novel Tom Jones. He also holds a place in the history of law enforcement, having used his authority as a magistrate to found the Bow Street Runners, which some have called London's first police force.
