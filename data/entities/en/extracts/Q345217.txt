Lucio Fulci (Italian: [ˈlutʃo ˈfultʃi]; 17 June 1927 – 13 March 1996) was an Italian film director, screenwriter and actor. 
Although he worked in a wide array of genres through a career as a film director spanning nearly five decades, including comedy and spaghetti westerns, he garnered an international cult following for his giallo and horror films. His most notable films include the "Gates of Hell" trilogy—City of the Living Dead (1980), The Beyond (1981), and The House by the Cemetery (1981)—as well as Massacre Time (1966), One on Top of the Other (1969), A Lizard in a Woman's Skin (1971), Don't Torture a Duckling (1972), White Fang (1973), Four of the Apocalypse (1975), Sette note in nero (1977), Zombi 2 (1979), The New York Ripper(1982), and A Cat in the Brain (1990). Although a number of films over the years were said to have been "co-produced" by Fulci, he was just allowing them to use his name to promote the films (with the exception of City of the Living Dead, which he did actively attempt to obtain some funding for).
Because of the high level of visceral graphic violence present in many of his films, especially Zombi 2, The Beyond, Contraband and The New York Ripper, Fulci is frequently referred to as "The Godfather of Gore", a title also given to Herschell Gordon Lewis.
