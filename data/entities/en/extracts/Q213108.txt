Barking at the Stars (Serbian: Лајање на звезде / Lajanje na zvezde) is a 1998 Yugoslav film directed by Zdravko Šotra.
Plot: 
It was the year 1963. The class is IV2. It's their last year of high school. A boy they call the Philosopher is catching feelings for his classmate, Danica. He's a lot smarter than other students, sometimes even than other professors. There's also his best friend, who is trying to practise boxing for his big match in the capital. His PE teacher prepares him for it passionately. In this story, everyone finds his/her soulmate, even the professors. The Philosopher wants to win over Danica's heart, but he has a rival, his own older brother who appears to be cooler because he has a motorbike and earns money on his own. 
Danica tries hard to resist all the flirting and everything the Philosopher says to her, the way he's trying to win her heart. But eventually, she can't fight back anymore. They go to excursion, with their main professor and along the way, they have their first kiss. This story is all a memory of this couple, long after the high school finished. They're now married and have a son who is going to the prom, using dad's old pick up lines to win a girl over. The movie ends with the legendary quote from the Philosopher where he confessed his feelings to Danica for the first time "Kako Tanjug javlja, ja te volim" going out and barking at the stars.
