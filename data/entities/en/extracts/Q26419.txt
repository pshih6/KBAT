Justin Portal Welby (born 6 January 1956) is the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury and the most senior Bishop in the Church of England. He has served in that role since 2013. Welby was the Vicar of Southam, Warwickshire, and most recently was the Bishop of Durham, serving for just over a year. As Archbishop of Canterbury, he is the primate of all England and the head primus inter pares of the worldwide Anglican Communion.
Welby was educated at the University of Cambridge where he read History and Law. Later in life, he received an ordination at St John's College, Durham. After several parochial appointments, he became the Dean of Liverpool in 2007 and the Bishop of Durham in 2011.
Welby's theology is reported as representing the evangelical tradition within Anglicanism. Having worked in business before his ordination, some of his publications explore the relationship between finance and religion and, as a member of the House of Lords, he sits on the panel of the 2012 Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards.
