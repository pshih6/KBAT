Dr. Frank Marion Wanlass (May 17, 1933 in Thatcher, AZ â€“ September 9, 2010 in Santa Clara, California) was an American electrical engineer. He is best known for inventing CMOS (complementary MOS) logic with Chih-Tang Sah in 1963. CMOS has since become the standard semiconductor device fabrication process for MOSFETs (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors).
