Russian Opposition Coordination Council (Russian: Координационный совет российской оппозиции) was a council created in October 2012 by Russian protesters. Due to the fractured nature of the opposition, in June 2012 activists decided to create a 45-member Opposition Coordination Council (OCC), which would try to coordinate and direct dissent in Russia.
Elections for the council were held on 20–22 October 2012. 170,000 people had registered on the site cvk2012.org, of whom nearly 98,000 were classed as "verified" and nearly 82,000 had cast their votes. The council was dissolved in October 2013.
