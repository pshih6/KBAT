Albert John Dunlap (July 26, 1937 â€“ January 25, 2019) was an American corporate executive. He was known at the peak of his career as a turnaround management specialist via mass layoffs, which earned him the nicknames "Chainsaw Al" and "Rambo in Pinstripes", after he posed for a photo wearing an ammo belt across his chest. It was later discovered that his reputed turnarounds were elaborate frauds and his career was ended after he engineered a massive accounting scandal at Sunbeam Products, now a division of Newell Brands, that forced the company into bankruptcy. Dunlap is on the lists of "Worst CEOs of All Time" published by several business publications. Fast Company noted that Dunlap "might score impressively on the Corporate Psychopathy checklist" and in an interview, Dunlap freely admitted to possessing many of the traits of a psychopath, but considered them positive traits such as leadership and decisiveness. He was a major benefactor of Florida State University.
