Futabatei Shimei (二葉亭 四迷, 4 April 1864 – 10 May 1909) was a Japanese author, translator, and literary critic. Born Hasegawa Tatsunosuke (長谷川 辰之助) in Edo (now Tokyo), Futabatei's works are in the realist style popular in the mid- to late-19th century. His work Ukigumo (Floating Clouds, 1887) is widely hailed as Japan's first modern novel.
