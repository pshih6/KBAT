Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam is a 1987 American documentary film inspired by the anthology of the same title, directed by Bill Couturi√© in 1987. Using real letters written by American soldiers (which can be read in the book along with many more) and archive footage, the film creates a highly personal experience of the Vietnam War. The film won the Special Jury Prize: Documentary at the Sundance Film Festival in 1988. It was also screened out of competition at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival.Roger Ebert commented, "There have been many great movies about Vietnam. This is the one that completes the story."
