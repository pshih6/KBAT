The Kingpin (Wilson Fisk) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by Stan Lee and John Romita Sr., and first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #50 (cover-dated July 1967).One of the most feared, dangerous and powerful crime lords in the Marvel Universe by typically holding the position of New York City's crime overlord, he was initially an adversary of Spider-Man, and later went on to become the arch-enemy of Daredevil, as well as a recurring foe of the Punisher. The Kingpin's signature look is his extraordinarily heavyset appearance with most of his mass consisting of muscle while usually wearing a white suit jacket and carrying a cane which he tips with diamonds or other hard substances as necessary to aid in physical combat. The "Kingpin" name is a reference to the crimelord title in Mafia slang nomenclature. 
IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains Of All Time List ranked the Kingpin as number 10. Wilson Fisk has been portrayed by John Rhys-Davies, Michael Clarke Duncan, Vincent D'Onofrio, and voiced by Liev Schreiber in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.
