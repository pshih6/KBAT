Modernism is both a philosophical movement and an art movement that, along with cultural trends and changes, arose from wide-scale and far-reaching transformations in Western society during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Among the factors that shaped modernism were the development of modern industrial societies and the rapid growth of cities, followed then by reactions to the horrors of World War I.
Modernism, in general, reflected a departure from traditional forms of art, religion, philosophy, social organization, and daily life which modernist artists felt had become outdated in the new environments of an emerging industrialized world. The poet Ezra Pound's 1934 injunction to "Make it new!" was the touchstone of the movement's approach towards what it saw as the now obsolete culture of the past. Modernism also rejected the certainty of Enlightenment thinking, and many modernists also rejected religious belief.Modernist innovations, like abstract art, the stream-of-consciousness novel, atonal (or pantonal) and twelve-tone music, and divisionist painting all had precursors in the 19th century. A notable characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness concerning artistic and social traditions, which often led to experimentation with form, along with the use of techniques that drew attention to the processes and materials used in creating works of art. Modernism explicitly rejected the ideology of realism and made use of the works of the past by the employment of reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision and parody.While some scholars see modernism continuing into the 21st century, others see it evolving into late modernism or high modernism. Postmodernism is a departure from modernism and refutes its basic assumptions.
