Henry Lehrman (March 30, 1881 â€“ November 7, 1946) was an American actor, screenwriter, director and producer. Lehrman was a very prominent figure of Hollywood's silent film era, working with such cinematic pioneers as D.W. Griffith and Mack Sennett. However, he is primarily remembered today not for his own achievements, but for three biographical facts: he had directed, as well as co-starred in, Charlie Chaplin's very first film, Making a Living (though Chaplin and he didn't get along); he was notoriously careless of the safety of the actors who worked for him; and he was the lover of the actress Virginia Rappe, for whose death Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle, in a highly-publicized series of trials, was accused, and later acquitted, of manslaughter.
