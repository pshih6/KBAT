Jorge Mas Canosa (21 September 1939 â€“ 23 November 1997) was a Cuban-American immigrant who founded the Cuban American National Foundation and MasTec, a publicly traded company. Regarded within the United States as a powerful lobbyist on Cuban and anti-Castro political positions, he was labeled a "counterrevolutionary" by the Cuban Communist Party. He has received criticism for his relationship with Luis Posada Carriles.
