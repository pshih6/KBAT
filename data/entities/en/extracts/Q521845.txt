Florian Fricke (23 February 1944 â€“ 29 December 2001) was a German musician who started his professional career with electronic music using the Moog synthesizer within the krautrock group Popol Vuh. His music and that of the band however  soon evolved in a completely different direction, and he almost completely abandoned synthesizers in favor of the acoustic piano.
