Svetlana Ražnatović (née Veličković; Serbian Cyrillic: Светлана Ражнатовић née Величковић, pronounced [sʋětlana raʒnǎːtoʋit͡ɕ] née [ʋelǐtʃkoʋit͡ɕ]; born 14 June 1973), better known under her stage name Ceca (Serbian Cyrillic: Цеца, pronounced [t͡sěːt͡sa]), is a Serbian turbo-folk singer. Born in Prokuplje and raised in the nearby village of Žitorađa, she rose to fame in 1988 with her debut album Cvetak zanovetak (Nagging Flower). Over the course of her career, Ceca has sold close to four million records and has held some of the biggest concerts by a Serbian singer, making her one of the most successful regional performers.
Despite her immense popularity, she is also deemed controversial, mainly because of her marriage to career criminal and commander in the Yugoslav Wars, Željko Ražnatović Arkan, as well as for her own legal issues and political involvements.
