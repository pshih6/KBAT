Georges Jean Raymond Pompidou ( POMP-id-oo, French: [ʒɔʁʒ pɔ̃pidu] (listen); 5 July 1911 – 2 April 1974) was a French politician who served as President of France from 1969 until his death in 1974. He previously was Prime Minister of France from 1962 to 1968—the longest tenure in the position's history. He had long been a top aide to President Charles de Gaulle; as head of state, he was a moderate conservative who repaired France's relationship with the United States and maintained positive relations with the newly independent former colonies in Africa.
He strengthened his political party, the Union of Democrats for the Republic ("Union des Democrates pour la Ve République" or UDR), to make it a  bastion of the Gaullist movement. Pompidou's presidency is generally held in high esteem by French political commentators.
