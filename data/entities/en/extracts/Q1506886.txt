George Ashley Campbell (November 27, 1870 â€“ November 10, 1954) was an American engineer.  He was pioneer in developing and applying quantitative mathematical methods to the problems of long-distance telegraphy and telephony.  His most important contributions were to the theory and implementation of the use of loading coils and the first wave filters designed to what was to become known as the image method.  Both these areas of work resulted in important economic advantages for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T).
