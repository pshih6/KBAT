Robert Percell Ferguson (May 9, 1929 â€“ November 26, 2006), who performed as H-Bomb Ferguson, was an American jump blues singer. He was an early pioneer of the rock and roll style of the mid-1950s, featuring driving rhythm, intensely shouted vocals, honking tenor saxophone solos, and outlandish personal appearance.  Ferguson sang and played piano in a flamboyant style, wearing colorful wigs.
