Miller was a conservative Democrat as a senator in the 2000s, after having been more liberal as governor in the 1990s. In 2004, he supported Republican President George W. Bush against Democratic nominee John Kerry in the presidential election. Miller was a keynote speaker at both major American political parties' national conventions—Democratic in 1992 and Republican in 2004.
