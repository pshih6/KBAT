Berta Lask (17 November 1878 â€“ 28 March 1967) was a German writer, playwright and journalist.  She joined the Communist Party in 1923 and much of her published work is strongly polemical.Sources identify her under several different names.  Between her marriage to Louis Jacobsohn in 1901 and 1917 she used, for some purposes, the name Berta Jacobsohn.   After the death of both her brothers in law, the couple changed their name to Jacobsohn-Lask.   She also wrote under the pseudonym "Gerhard Wieland".
