The Faculté de droit de l'Université Laval is the law school of Université Laval. Founded in 1852, it is one of the oldest institutions of its kind in North America. It hosts more than 1,000 students in its curriculum of first, second, and third years, with more than 45 lecturers teaching and supervising research projects in most areas of law. The research activity is particularly intense in the field of human rights and public freedoms in light of legal issues, economic law, environmental law, public law, and private international trade.
Teaching and research are based on a law library with more than 200,000 documents, which receives subscriptions of several hundred legal periodicals from Quebec, Canada, and internationally.
