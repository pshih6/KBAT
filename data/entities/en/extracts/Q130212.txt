The city of Székesfehérvár (Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈseːkɛʃfɛheːrvaːr] (listen)), known colloquially as Fehérvár ("white castle"), located in central Hungary, is the ninth largest city of the country; regional capital of Central Transdanubia; and the centre of Fejér county and Székesfehérvár District. The area is an important rail and road junction between Lake Balaton and Lake Velence.
Székesfehérvár, a royal residence (székhely), as capital of the Kingdom of Hungary, held a central role in the Middle Ages. As required by the Doctrine of the Holy Crown, the first kings of Hungary were crowned and buried here. Significant trade routes led to the Balkans and Italy, and to Buda and Vienna. Historically the city has come under Ottoman and Habsburg control, and was known in many languages by translations of "white castle": (Latin: Alba Regia, German: Stuhlweißenburg, Ottoman Turkish: İstolni Belgrad‎, Slovak: Stoličný Belehrad)
