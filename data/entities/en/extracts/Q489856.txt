After a series of roles in television and film during the 1990s and 2000s, including a minor part in Forrest Gump playing the title character's son (also named Forrest Gump), Osment rose to fame for his performance as a young unwilling medium in M. Night Shyamalan's thriller film The Sixth Sense, which earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He subsequently appeared in leading roles in several high-profile Hollywood films, including Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence, Mimi Leder's Pay It Forward, and Secondhand Lions, alongside Michael Caine and Robert Duvall.
He made his Broadway debut in 2008 in a short-lived revival of David Mamet's play American Buffalo, starring John Leguizamo and Cedric the Entertainer. Osment is also known for his voice-roles of Sora and Vanitas in the Kingdom Hearts video games, as well as his later roles in comedies such as Sex Ed and The Spoils of Babylon.
