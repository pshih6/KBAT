The National Theatre School of Canada (NTS, French: École nationale de théâtre du Canada) is a private institution of professional theatre studies in Montreal, Quebec. Established in 1960, The NTS receives its principal funding from grants awarded by the Government of Canada and from cultural ministries in each of the provinces, with added financial support from private and corporate donors.
The NTS offers intensive, highly specialized theatre arts training in both English and French languages in a setting that unites all the related disciplines: acting, playwriting, directing, set and costume design, and production.
