The Radical Civic Union (Spanish: Unión Cívica Radical, UCR) is a centrist social-liberal political party in Argentina. The party has been ideologically heterogeneous, ranging from social liberalism to social democracy. The UCR is a member of the Socialist International.
Founded in 1891 by radical liberals, it is the oldest political party active in Argentina after the Liberal Party of Corrientes. For many years the party was either in opposition to Peronist governments or illegal during military rule. The UCR's main support comes from the middle class. Throughout its history the party has stood for free elections, supremacy of civilians over the military, and liberal democratic values. Especially during the 1970s and 1980s it was perceived as a strong advocate for human rights. By May 2014, the UCR had 42 Deputies and 14 Senators.
