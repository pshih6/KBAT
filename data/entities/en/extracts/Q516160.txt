The First Hungarian Republic (Hungarian: Első Magyar Köztársaság), until 21 March 1919 the Hungarian People's Republic (Magyar Népköztársaság), was a short-lived unrecognized people's republic that existed – apart from a 133-day interruption in the form of the Hungarian Soviet Republic – from 16 November 1918 until 8 August 1919. The republic was established in the wake of the dissolution of Austria-Hungary following World War I. The First Hungarian Republic replaced the Kingdom of Hungary, and was in turn replaced by the Hungarian Republic, another short-lived state from 1919 to 1920. During the rule of Count Mihály Károlyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost the control over approximately 75% of its former pre-World War I territories (325,411 km2 (125,642 sq mi)) without armed resistance and was subject to foreign occupation. 
Following this period, the Allied Powers of World War I severely pressured the Hungarians into retreating behind post-war demarcation lines as a provision to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, their attempt to establish new nation states among the former kingdom's non-Hungarian citizens – the principal beneficiaries of which were the Kingdom of Romania, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, the Austrian Republic, and the Czechoslovak Republic. The subsequent Treaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Hungary was signed under protest by the latter.
