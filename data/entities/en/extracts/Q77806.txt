Gottlieb Wilhelm Eduard Redecker (30 April 1871, Otjimbingwe - 21 January 1945) was a German engineer and architect in South West Africa. He was responsible for a number of important buildings which still stand today in Namibia, particularly in Windhoek, including the national assembly building, the Tintenpalast.
