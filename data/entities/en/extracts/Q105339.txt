Karl Eberhard Zwicker (15 January 1924, in Öhringen, Germany – 22 November 1990, in Icking)
was a German acoustics scientist and full professor at the Technical University of Munich.
Zwicker studied physics and electrical engineering at the University of Stuttgart and was an assistant of Richard Feldtkeller. In 1967 he was appointed full professor of the newly founded Institute for Electro-Acoustics of the Technical University of Munich.
Zwicker developed a method for the computation of loudness, which became a German standard, DIN 45631.
Zwicker, together with Richard Feldtkeller, was author of the standard work for psychoacoustics Das Ohr als Nachrichtenempfänger. (The Ear as Message Receiver).
In 1964, at Bell Labs, he discovered the Zwicker tone auditory illusion.
