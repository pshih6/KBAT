The Nizari Ismaili state, also called the Alamut State, was a Shia Nizari Ismaili state founded by the Order of Assassins under Hassan-i Sabbah after he took control of the Alamut Castle in 1090 AD. The state included a nexus of strategic fortresses throughout Persia and Syria, with each stronghold being surrounded by huge swathes of hostile territory, in particular, the Seljuk Empire.
The order of the Assassins was formed as a result of a religious and political movement of the minority Nizari Ismaili sect supported by the anti-Seljuk population. Being heavily outnumbered, they resisted adversaries by employing strategic strongholds and the use of unconventional tactics, such as assassination of important figures and psychological warfare.
Two centuries after its foundation, the state declined internally under Rukn al-Din Khurshah, who eventually dismantled and surrendered the Alamut Castle to the invading Mongols. Much of what is known about the Nizaris are based on hostile sources.
