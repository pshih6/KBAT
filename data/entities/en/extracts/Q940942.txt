Enrico Ferri (Italian pronunciation: [enˈriːko ˈfɛrri]; 25 February 1856 – 12 April 1929) was an Italian criminologist, socialist and student of Cesare Lombroso (['tʃe:zare lom'bro:zo]), the founder of the Italian school of criminology. While Lombroso researched the purported physiological factors that motivated criminals, Ferri investigated social and economic aspects. He served as editor of the socialist daily Avanti! and, in 1884, saw his book Criminal Sociology published. Later, his work served as the basis for Argentina’s penal code of 1921. Although at first he rejected the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, Ferri later became one of Mussolini and his National Fascist Party's main external supporters.
