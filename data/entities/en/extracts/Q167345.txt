Jens Ingebret Evensen (5 November 1917 – 15 February 2004) was a Norwegian lawyer, judge, politician (for the Labour Party), trade minister, international offshore rights expert, member of the International Law Commission and judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
He negotiated Norway's trading deal with European Economic Community in 1972 as minister of commerce in which he served in the governments of both Trygve Bratteli and Odvar Nordli. He then served as maritime law minister until 1979. He worked to secure government income from Norwegian oil discoveries. The UN's oceans treaty (1982) is greatly fundamental based on Evensen's work. Former Labour Party politician and head of Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) Einar Førde called Jens Evensen "one of the great Norwegians of the last century".
