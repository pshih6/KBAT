Keith Russell Ablow (born November 23, 1961) is an American author, television personality, and former psychiatrist. He is a contributor for Fox News Channel and TheBlaze. 
Formerly an assistant clinical professor at Tufts University School of Medicine, Ablow resigned as a member of the American Psychiatric Association in 2011. Ablow's medical license was suspended in May 2019 by the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine. The board concluded he posed an "immediate and serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare," alleging that he had engaged in sexual and unethical misconduct towards patients.According to the Associated Press, Ablow "freely mixes psychiatric assessments with political criticism, a unique twist in the realm of cable news commentary that some medical colleagues find unethical."
