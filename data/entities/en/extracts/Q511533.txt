La Vanguardia (Catalan: [lə βəŋˈɡwaɾðiə]; Spanish: [la βaŋˈɡwaɾðja], Spanish for "The Vanguard") is a Spanish daily newspaper, founded in 1881. It is printed in Spanish and, since 3 May 2011, also in Catalan (Spanish copy is automatically translated into Catalan). It has its headquarters in Barcelona and is Catalonia's leading newspaper.
La Vanguardia, despite being mostly distributed in Catalonia, has Spain's fourth-highest circulation among general-interest newspapers, trailing only the three main Madrid dailies – El País, El Mundo and ABC, all of which are national newspapers with offices and local editions throughout the country.
Its editorial line leans to the centre of politics and is moderate in its opinions, although in Francoist Spain it followed Francoist ideology and to this day has Catholic sensibilities and strong ties to the Spanish nobility through the Godó family.
