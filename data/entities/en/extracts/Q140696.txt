James Hargreaves (c. 1720 â€“ 22 April 1778) was a weaver, carpenter and inventor who lived and worked in Lancashire, England.  He was one of three men responsible for the mechanisation of spinning: Hargreaves is credited with inventing the spinning jenny in 1764; Richard Arkwright patented the water frame in 1769; and Samuel Crompton combined the two, creating the spinning mule in 1779.
