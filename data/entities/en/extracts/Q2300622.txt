The Independent Republicans (French: Républicains Indépendants, RI) were a liberal-conservative political group in France founded in 1962, which became a political party in 1966 known as the National Federation of the Independent Republicans (Fédération nationale des républicains et indépendants, FNRI). Its leader was Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
In 1977 it became the Republican Party which joined the Union for French Democracy (UDF) the following year. Eventually, through Liberal Democracy, the Republicans joined the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) in 2002.
