Samad Behrangi (Persian: صمد بهرنگی; June 24, 1939 – August 31, 1967) was an Iranian teacher, social critic, folklorist, translator, and short story writer. He is famous for his children's books, particularly The Little Black Fish. Influenced by predominantly leftist ideologies that were common among the intelligentsia of his era, his books typically portrayed the lives of the children of the urban poor and encouraged the individual to change his/ her circumstances by her own initiatives.
