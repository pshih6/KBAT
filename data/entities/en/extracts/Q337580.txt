The Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium (French: Académie royale des sciences, des lettres et des beaux-arts de Belgique, sometimes referred to as La Thérésienne) is the independent learned society of science and arts of the French Community of Belgium. One of Belgium's numerous academies, it is the French-speaking counterpart of the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts. In 2001 both academies founded a joint association for the purpose of promoting science and arts on an international level: The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium (RASAB). All three institutions are located in the same building, the Academy Palace in Brussels.
