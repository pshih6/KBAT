Walt Brown (December 30, 1911 â€“ July 29, 1951) was an American racecar driver.  A Champ Car specialist, his career in the big cars began in 1941, and he recorded one win, in 1948 at Langhorne Speedway.
Brown died in a low speed accident at Williams Grove Speedway on 29 July 1951, the day widely known as "Black Sunday" because two other drivers also died (in consecutive qualifying runs at Funk's Speedway in Winchester, Indiana) on the same day.
