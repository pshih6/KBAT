Sándor Bródy (July 23, 1863 in Eger – August 12, 1924 in Budapest) was a Hungarian author and journalist.
After attending the schools of that city he devoted himself entirely to literature. From 1888 to 1890 he was editor of the "Erdélyi Híradó", published at Kolozsvár (present-day Cluj-Napoca), and was also connected with the "Erdélyi Képes Ujság" and the political daily "Magyarság". Since 1890 he was a member of the "Magyar Hírlap", and since 1882 a prolific contributor of articles, feuilletons, stories, and novels to the leading literary publications of Hungary. In his works he depicts the dark side of life, and is a disciple of the modern French realistic school.
In 1995, the literary award  Sándor Bródy prize recognizing the best first novel of the year published in Hungarian was established in his honor by his grandson, the Hungarian American Alexander Brody.
