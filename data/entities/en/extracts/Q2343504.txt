Benjamin Reilly (), also known as the Scarlet Spider, is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is a clone and ally of the original Spider-Man (Peter Parker) and is prominent in the 1994â€“96 "Clone Saga" storyline, which led to his murder by the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn).
Created by writer Gerry Conway, the character first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #149 (October 1975). During the "Clone Saga" storyline, he came to wear a makeshift costume similar to Spider-Man's consisting of a blue sleeveless hoodie sweatshirt adorned with black motifs of a spider on its front and back, over a red spandex bodysuit and mask, with utility belts and wrist-worn sizable web-shooters that were designed by artist Tom Lyle, before donning a variation of Spider-Man's costume designed by artist Mark Bagley as his successor for some time before his death.
In 2017's "Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy" story arc, the character was resurrected. In the 2017 series Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider, he reclaims his Scarlet Spider identity and reimagined by Marvel Comics' creative teams as an antihero, starting a spiritual quest to redeem himself as a true hero once more and has completed it in another arc, "Spider-Geddon", again serving as Spider-Man's heroic ally.
