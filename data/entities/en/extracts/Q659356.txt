Don Luis José Sartorius y Tapia, 1st Count of San Luis (Seville, Spain, 1820 – Madrid, Spain, 22 February 1871) was a Spanish noble, politician and journalist who served as Prime Minister of Spain from 1853 to 1854, during the reign of Queen Isabella II.
Sartorius, a man of very traditional convictions, was the leader of a faction of the Moderate Party which, because of his erroneously supposed Polish origin, was known as los polacos ("the Poles"). His newspaper, El Herlado, became one of the mainstays of the moderates during the regency of the Progressivist Baldomero Espartero. During the Moderate decade (1844-1854), Sartorius held several political offices, especially three times as Ministry of the Interior (Ministro de Gobernacion) in 1847, 1849-1851 and 1853-1854. He became Prime Minister between 1853 and 1854.
