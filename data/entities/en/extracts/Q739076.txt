Frederick Stibbert (9 November 1838 â€“ 10 April 1906) was an English art collector and businessman, although he was born in Italy. His figure is mainly linked to the work to which he dedicated his entire life, the Stibbert Museum, gathering a collection of the most disparate genres of art and applied arts, with particular regard to the collection of ancient weapons and armors, among the most conspicuous and important in the world of its kind. His name is also spelled Federigo or Federico Stibbert.
