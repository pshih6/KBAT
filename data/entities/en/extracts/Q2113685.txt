Dick Hutcherson (November 30, 1931 – November 6, 2005) was an American businessman and a former stock car racer. A native of Keokuk, Iowa, Hutcherson drove in NASCAR competition from 1964 to 1967. In 1965 he finished second in the overall NASCAR Drivers Championship and had nine wins. In 1967 he finished third overall but after four years of top-level racing he retired at the season's end to devote his energies to "Hutcherson-Pagan Enterprises," a highly respected chassis-building business in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Dick hailed from Keokuk, Iowa, which has long been called the "Home of Champions" and the "Racing Capital of the World" along with his younger brother Ron. The “Keokuk Gang” consisted of “Old Man” Ernie Derr, Don White, Ramo Stott and Hutcherson himself. Dick Hutcherson said of Derr: 'Got to beat the old man. The old man will be tough to beat if you have to haul him out in a wheelchair.' He started racing in 1956 and moved up to the International Motor Contest Association (IMCA) circuit in 1959. Hutch was a quick learner and very competitive and took the IMCA championship in 1963 and 1964. He was the Late Model champion at Huron, South Dakota’s Dakota State Fair Speedway in 1960 and 1964. He has 81 IMCA wins to his credit. During this time he also raced in the Midwest Association for Race Cars circuit.
In the spring of 1962 Curtis Turner fielded a race at Virginia International Raceway in an attempt to compete head to head with NASCAR [2]. The road race was on April 1, in direct competition with the regular event at Richmond the same day. Most of the NASCAR regulars chose to compete at Richmond, some because they were afraid to incur the wrath of Bill France. Entries in Turner’s race included Tim Flock, who had been NASCAR Champion in both 1952 and 1955, three time NASCAR Convertible Division Champion Bob Welborn, and Hutcherson.
