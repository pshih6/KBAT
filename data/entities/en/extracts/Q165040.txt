The Duchy of Parma is a noble estate and title created in Italy in 1545. Originally a title of the Farnese family, in 1731, the Duchy passed to the Habsburgs and in 1748 to the Bourbons. The title is now held by a branch of the Bourbon-Parma family that are cousins of the monarch of the Netherlands.
