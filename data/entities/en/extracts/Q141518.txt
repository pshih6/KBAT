Big Business is a 1988 American comedy film starring Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin (each playing two roles).  The movie revolves around two sets of identical female twins mismatched at birth, with one of each pair ending in a wealthy urban family (the Sheltons) and the other in a poor rural family (the Ratliffs). It was produced by Touchstone Pictures, with the plot loosely based on The Comedy of Errors (1589â€“1594) by William Shakespeare.
The film co-stars Chris Aable who also played twins in a scene with Fred Ward, Edward Herrmann, Joe Grifasi, and Seth Green, as well as siblings Michael Gross and Mary Gross. Directed by Jim Abrahams, critical reaction to the film as a whole was generally lukewarm. Midler received an American Comedy Award in the category Funniest Actress in a Motion Picture for her performance and Tomlin was nominated for the same award in 1989.
