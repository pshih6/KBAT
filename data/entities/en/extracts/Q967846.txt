Umberto Agnelli (Italian: [umˈbɛrto aɲˈɲɛlli]; 1 November 1934 – 27 May 2004) was an Italian industrialist and politician. He was the third son of Virginia Agnelli (born Donna Virginia Bourbon del Monte) and of Edoardo Agnelli, and the youngest brother of Gianni Agnelli.
He served as a CEO of Italian carmaker Fiat from 1970 to 1976 and, on the death of his brother Gianni, was briefly chairman of the FIAT Group, 2003–2004, until his own death, aged 69, the following year. He was also chairman and later honorary chairman of Juventus, the football team long-associated with FIAT and the Agnelli family, and was for a time the president of the Italian Football Association. 
He was a senator of the Italian Republic, from 1976 to 1979. In 2015, he was posthumously inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame.
