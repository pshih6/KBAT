American History X is a 1998 American crime drama film directed by Tony Kaye and written by David McKenna. The film stars Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, as two brothers from Los Angeles who are involved in the white supremacist and neo-Nazi movements. The older brother (Norton) serves three years in prison for voluntary manslaughter, and during this time, he is rehabilitated, and then tries to prevent his brother from going down the same path. The supporting cast includes Fairuza Balk, Stacy Keach, Elliott Gould, Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee and Beverly D'Angelo. 
The story is fictional, but the characters are based on McKenna's childhood and experiences of growing up in San Diego. Eager to adapt it into a film, he then sold the script to New Line Cinema, who were impressed by the writing. American History X was Kaye's first directorial role in a feature film. Budgeted at $20 million, filming took place in 1997. Before the film's release, Kaye and the film studio were hampered by a number of disputes about the final cut of the film. The final version was longer than Kaye intended, which resulted in him publicly disowning the film, and hurting his own career in Hollywood.
The film was released in the United States on October 30, 1998 and distributed by New Line Cinema. Despite lukewarm success at the box office, grossing only $24 million worldwide, American History X was acclaimed by critics. In particular, Norton was praised for his compelling and realistic performance, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. The film has stayed relevant over the years, especially because of the rise of white nationalism and far-right movements. The film has also been used for educational purposes in the United States and in other countries.
