Amadou & Mariam are a musical duo from Mali, composed of the Bamako-born couple Amadou Bagayoko (guitar and vocals) (born 24 October 1954) and Mariam Doumbia (vocals) (born 15 April 1958).
Their album Welcome To Mali (2008) was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary World Music Album.
Amadou lost his vision at the age of 16, while Mariam became blind at age 5 as a consequence of untreated measles.[1] Known as "the blind couple from Mali", they met at Mali's Institute for the Young Blind, where they both performed at the Instituteâ€™s Eclipse Orchestra, directed by Idrissa Soumaouro, and found they shared an interest in music.
