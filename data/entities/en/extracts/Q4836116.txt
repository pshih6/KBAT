BNA Records, formerly known as BNA Entertainment, was a label group that shared ties with Arista Nashville and RCA Nashville from parent company Sony Music Nashville, which itself is a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment. Based in Nashville, Tennessee, BNA featured country music acts on its roster. The company derived its name from the IATA and ICAO airport codes for Nashville International Airport.
The label was founded by Boomer Castleman, who sold it to BMG Music in 1993. The first act signed was The Remingtons.
In August 2011, Sony Nashville announced a major corporate restructuring which included the merger of Columbia Nashville into BNA. The BNA name was retired in June 2012, with the last remaining artists moving to a newly re-established Columbia Nashville.
