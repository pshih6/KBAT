A hymn writer (or hymnwriter or hymnist or hymnographer) is someone who writes the text, music or both of hymns. In the Judeo-Christian tradition the composition of hymns dates back to before the time of David who composed many of the Psalms.  The term hymnodist, in the USA more than in other regions, broadens the scope to include the study of hymns.
