Kari Arvo Ilari "Kärtsy" Hatakka (born December 17, 1967 in Helsinki, Finland) is the vocalist and bassist for the Finnish music group Waltari, which he founded in 1986.
Kärtsy is recognized as one of the most remarkable faces in Finnish rock history. Besides Waltari, Kärtsy has lived as a full-time musician since 1991, and therefore has also had a lot of other remarkable musical engagements in different fields of music including a pioneering soundtrack work for the Finnish computer game Max Payne (parts 1 and 2) with Kimmo Kajasto.
