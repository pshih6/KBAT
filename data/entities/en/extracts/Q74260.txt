Wolfgang Stammberger (14 July 1920 â€“ 1 May 1982) was a German jurist and politician. He served as German Minister of Justice from 1961 to 1962.
Born in Coburg, Bavaria, Stammberger saw his studies interrupted by World War II, but eventually earned his doctorate from the University of Erlangen. He became a member of the German Bundestag in 1953, and retained his seat until 1969. In 1964, he switched from the Free Democratic Party to the Social Democratic Party. Between 1970 and 1978, he served as mayor of Coburg.
His niece, Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, later served as Minister of Justice, too.
