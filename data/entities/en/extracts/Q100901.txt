By the age of 20, she was writing poetry and short stories that were published in local newspapers. In 1933, she completed her first novel Der Ausgestoßene (The outcast); it was accepted for publication but was not released due to the political environment in Germany at the time.

She published the novel Labyrint (Dutch) in 1955. A German version Auswege appeared in 1988; it was to be her last novel, although she continued to produce poetry, short stories and radio plays.In 1992, she was awarded the Jacobson award for her work.She died in Amsterdam in 2001.
