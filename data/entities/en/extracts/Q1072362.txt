The Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (PRG), was formed on June 8, 1969, by North Vietnam as a purportedly independent shadow country and government that opposed the government of the Republic of Vietnam under President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu in the South Vietnam. Delegates of the National Liberation Front (the Viet Cong), as well as several smaller groups, participated in its creation.
The PRG was recognized as the government of South Vietnam by most communist states. It signed the 1973 Paris Peace Treaty as an independent entity, that was separate from both South Vietnam and North Vietnam. It became the provisional government of South Vietnam following the military defeat of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam on April 30, 1975. On July 2, 1976, Republic of South Vietnam and North Vietnam merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.
