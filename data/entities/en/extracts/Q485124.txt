Fernando Araújo Perdomo (born 27 June 1955 in Cartagena, Bolivar) is a Colombian politician. He was the Minister of Development during the administration of Andrés Pastrana. He resigned from this post after the Chambacú land deal scandal. He was later kidnapped by the FARC-EP guerrillas and held for six years until he eventually escaped. Two months later after his liberation, president Álvaro Uribe appointed him as Minister of Foreign Affairs.
