Etterbeek (French: [ɛtəʁbek]; Dutch: [ˈɛtərˌbeːk] (listen)) is one of the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region (Belgium).  It neighbours the municipalities of Auderghem, the City of Brussels, Ixelles, Schaerbeek, Woluwe-Saint-Lambert and Woluwe-Saint-Pierre. In common with all of Brussels' municipalities, it is legally bilingual (French–Dutch).
The main university campus of Vrije Universiteit Brussel is called Campus Etterbeek, although it is geographically not within Etterbeek but in the adjacent municipality of Ixelles.
