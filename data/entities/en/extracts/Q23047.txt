Cahors (French pronunciation: ​[kaɔʁ]; Occitan: Caors [kaˈuɾs, ˈkɔws, ˈkɔw]) is a commune in the western part of Southern France. It is the smallest prefecture among the 13 departments that constitute the Occitanie Region. Main city of the Lot department and historical center of the Quercy, Cahors is home to 19 878 cadurciennes and cadurciens.
Nestled in a meander of the Lot and surrounded by steep arid limestone hills, this historic city is home to a great monumental diversity. Mainly inherited from Roman times and the Middle Ages; the city’s monumental attributes include a historic city centre, Saint-Etienne cathedral, Roman walls and the famous Valentré bridge (UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the pilgrimage path to Santiago de Compostela). Famed for its wine and gastronomy (truffles and foie gras) this typical southern French city holds the label of the French Towns of art and History. The cadurcian economy is reliant on Tertiary services and make Cahors the Lot’s economic centre.
