The Naked Brothers Band is an 2007 American children's musical comedy film written and directed by Polly Draper, which stars her sons, Nat Wolff and Alex Wolff, who portray members of a fictional rock group. It tells of the boys' struggles with their fame and an internal dispute that causes the band to split before reuniting in the end. The film is emboldened by Nat's band, The Silver Boulders, which he created in preschool with his friends Joshua Kaye, Thomas Batuello, and David Levi, who all portray themselves. It also includes Allie DiMeco as Nat's fictional female interest, the siblings' real-life cousin Jesse Draper as the group's babysitter, Draper's husband Michael Wolff playing his sons' widowed accordion-playing dad, and real life friends Cooper Pillot and Cole Hawkins portraying the other members of the band.
Draper shot the film in the style of a mockumentary—a parody in documentary format—that depicts the daily activities of the characters. Nat composed and performed the music, yet one song had been written by Alex. Principal photography took place in mid-2004 on location in New York City, and the interior scenes were vastly filmed in the family's Manhattan apartment. Draper's brother, Tim, a venture capitalist, provided financial incentives for the shoot.
In late 2005, Polly Draper, known for her role in Thirtysomething, and her jazz musician husband Michael Wolff entered the film at the Hamptons International Film Festival, where it won the audience award. Former Nickelodeon president Albie Hecht attended the screening and purchased the movie, in association with his Worldwide Biggies label. It became the pilot for the subsequent Nickelodeon show of the same name, airing in the United States on January 27, 2007. The series was created and produced by Draper and premiered in February 2007, to the channel's highest ratings in seven years for viewers in the 6–11 age group.
