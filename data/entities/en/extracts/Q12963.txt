François Bayrou (French pronunciation: ​[fʁɑ̃swa bajʁu], born 25 May 1951) is a French centrist politician and the president of the Democratic Movement (MoDem), who was a candidate in the 2002, 2007 and 2012 French presidential elections.
From 1993 to 1997, he was Minister of National Education for three governments. He was also a member of the National Assembly for a seat in Pyrénées-Atlantiques from 1986 to 2012, MEP from 1999 to 2002 and is currently the mayor of Pau since 2014.
It was speculated that Bayrou would be a candidate in the 2017 presidential election, but he decided not to run and instead supported Emmanuel Macron, who – after winning the election – named him Minister of State and Minister of Justice in the Philippe Government. On 21 June 2017, he resigned from the government amid an investigation into MoDem's allegedly fraudulent employment of parliamentary assistants, initiated earlier that month.
