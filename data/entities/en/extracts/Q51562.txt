Ernst Lubitsch (; January 29, 1892 â€“ November 30, 1947) was a German-American film director, producer, writer, and actor. His urbane comedies of manners gave him the reputation of being Hollywood's most elegant and sophisticated director; as his prestige grew, his films were promoted as having "the Lubitsch touch". Among his best known works are Trouble in Paradise, Design for Living, Ninotchka, The Shop Around the Corner, To Be or Not to Be and Heaven Can Wait.
In 1946, he received an Honorary Academy Award for his distinguished contributions to the art of the motion picture.
