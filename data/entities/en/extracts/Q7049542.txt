Nonpartisanism is a lack of affiliation with, and a lack of bias toward, a political party.While an Oxford English Dictionary definition of partisan includes adherents of a party, cause, person, etc., in most cases, nonpartisan refers specifically to political party connections rather than being the strict antonym of "partisan".
