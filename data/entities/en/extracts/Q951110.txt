Henry Lincoln (born Henry Soskin; 12 February 1930) is a British author, television presenter, scriptwriter, and actor. He co-wrote three Doctor Who multi-part serials in the 1960s, and — starting in the 1970s — inspired three Chronicle BBC Two documentaries on the alleged mysteries surrounding the French village of Rennes-le-Château (on which he was writer and presenter) — and, from the 1980s, co-authored and authored a series of books of which the The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail was the most popular, becoming the inspiration for Dan Brown's 2003 best-selling novel, The Da Vinci Code. He is now the last living person to have written Doctor Who in the 1960s.
