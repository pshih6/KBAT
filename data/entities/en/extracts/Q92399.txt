Albrecht Fölsing (1940 in Bad Salzungen – 8 April 2018 in Hamburg) was a trained physicist turned into a scientific journalist. Having studied physics in Berlin, Philadelphia, and Hamburg, he worked as an academic research assistant for the German electron synchrotron named DESY. In the years 1973-2001, Fölsing was head of the Nature and Science Department of the North German Radio and Television. He has written several biographies of well-known physicists and studies of the "cheating factor" in science. His most widely known book is perhaps Albert Einstein: A Biography, which also gathers many quotations by Einstein.
