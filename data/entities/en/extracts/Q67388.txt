Benedikt Waldeck (1802â€“1870, in Berlin) was a left-leaning deputy in the Prussian National Assembly and later in the Second Chamber. He was tried in Berlin for his political activity in December 1849. Sir John Retcliffe (real name: Hermann Goedsche) was centrally involved in a forgery scandal to discredit Waldeck and then lost his government position for his criminal participation. Waldeck is an important figure in German constitutional history.
