He became the leader of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna in 2019, splitting the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.A lawyer by profession, Rajapaksa was first elected to the Parliament of Sri Lanka in 1970, and he served as Prime Minister from 6 April 2004 until his victory in the 2005 presidential election. He was sworn in for his first six-year term as president on 19 November 2005. He was re-elected for a second term on 27 January 2010. He was defeated in his bid for a third term in the 2015 presidential election by Maithripala Sirisena and left office on 9 January 2015.Several months after leaving office, Rajapaksa unsuccessfully sought to become Prime Minister in the 2015 parliamentary election, where the United People's Freedom Alliance was defeated. He was, however, elected as Member of Parliament for Kurunegala District.On 26 October 2018, Rajapaksa was appointed as Prime Minister by President Maithripala Sirisena after the United People's Freedom Alliance withdrew from the unity government. Incumbent Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe refused to accept the dismissal stating that it was unconstitutional, resulting in a constitutional crisis.
Two no-confidence motions brought against Rajapaksa were passed by the Sri Lankan Parliament on 14 and 16 November 2018. Both were rejected by President Sirisena stating that proper procedures were not followed. On 3 December 2018, a court suspended Rajapaksa's powers as Prime Minister and ruled that his cabinet could not function until its legitimacy was established. Rajapaksa resigned as Prime Minister on 15 December 2018, with Ranil Wickremesinghe re-appointed as Prime Minister, and Rajapaksa appointed Leader of the Opposition.
