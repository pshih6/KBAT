Sir Francis Ronalds FRS (21 February 1788 â€“ 8 August 1873) was an English scientist and inventor, and arguably the first electrical engineer. He was knighted for creating the first working electric telegraph over a substantial distance. In 1816 he laid an eight-mile length of iron  wire between wooden frames in his garden and sent pulses using electrostatic generators.
