August Ivan Nepomuk Eduard Šenoa (pronounced [ǎuɡust ʃěːnoa]; originally Schönoa; 14 November 1838 – 13 December 1881) was a novelist.

He wrote more than ten novels, among which the most notable are:

Zlatarovo zlato (Goldsmith's gold; 1871)
Čuvaj se senjske ruke (Pirates of Senj; 1876)
Seljačka buna (Peasants' revolt; 1877)
Diogenes (1878)Šenoa was one of the most popular Croatian novelists and the author of the popular patriotic song "Živila Hrvatska".
