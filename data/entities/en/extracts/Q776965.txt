Klaipėda (Lithuanian pronunciation: [ˈkɫɐɪˑpʲeːdɐ], listen ; German: Memel or Mimmelburg, Samogitian: Klaipieda, is a city in Lithuania on the Baltic Sea coast. It is the third largest city in Lithuania and the capital of Klaipėda County.
The city has a complex recorded history, partially due to the combined regional importance of the usually ice-free Port of Klaipėda at the mouth of the Akmena-Danė River. It was controlled by successive German states until the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. As a result of the 1923 Klaipėda Revolt it was annexed by Lithuania and has remained with Lithuania to this day, except between 1939 and 1945 when it returned to Germany following the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania and Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact (between Germany and the Soviet Union).
The population has shrunk from the city to its suburbs and the hinterland. The number of inhabitants of Klaipėda city shrank from 207,100 in 1992 to 157,350 in 2014, but the urban zone of Klaipėda expanded well into the suburbs, which sprang around the city and surrounded it from three sides. These are well integrated with the city (city bus lines, city water supply, etc.) and the majority of inhabitants of these suburbs work in Klaipėda. According to statistics of Klaipėda territorial health insurance fund, there are 233,311 permanent inhabitants (as of 2019) in Klaipėda city and Klaipėda district municipalities combined. Popular seaside resorts found close to Klaipėda are Nida to the south on the Curonian Spit and Palanga to the north.
