The fortress, which was built in the 16th century, was once one of the most secure strongholds in France. The cemetery is as much popular for its function and history as for the scenic views of the city that affords.
The graveyard at Cimetière du Château, which was founded in 1783, has 2,800 graves, where some of Nice's most famous people lie buried.
