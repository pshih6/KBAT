François Picard (26 April 1921, Villefranche-sur-Saône, Rhône – 29 April 1996, Nice ) was a racing driver from France. He participated in one Formula One Grand Prix, on 19 October 1958.  He scored no championship points. This race was his last, as he crashed his Cooper into Olivier Gendebien's Ferrari, which had spun in front of him, and Picard suffered serious injuries. He eventually recovered, but never raced again.
