Alien vs. Predator (also known as AVP: Alien vs. Predator) is a 2004 science fiction action film written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, and starring Sanaa Lathan, Raoul Bova, Lance Henriksen and Ewen Bremner. It is the first installment of the Alien vs. Predator franchise, adapting a crossover bringing together the eponymous creatures of the Alien and Predator series, a concept which originated in a 1989 comic book written by Randy Stradley and Chris Warner. Anderson wrote the story together with the creators of the Alien franchise, Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, and Anderson and Shane Salerno adapted the story into a screenplay. Their writing was influenced by Aztec mythology, the comic book series, and the writings of Erich von DÃ¤niken. In the film, scientists are caught in the crossfires of an ancient battle between Aliens and Predators as they attempt to escape a bygone pyramid.
Alien vs. Predator was theatrically released on 12 August 2004 to negative reviews, and grossed $177.4 million worldwide against a production budget of $60 million. A sequel, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, was released in 2007.
