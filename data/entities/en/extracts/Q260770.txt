Grace Quek (Chinese: 郭盈恩; pinyin: Guō Yíng'ēn) (born May 22, 1972), stage name Annabel Chong, is a retired Singaporean-born American pornographic film actress who became famous after starring in an adult film that was promoted as The World's Biggest Gang Bang. The film was commercially successful and started a trend of "record-breaking" gang bang pornography. Four years later, Chong was the subject of the documentary Sex: The Annabel Chong Story, in which she was interviewed about her pornography career. Academically gifted, she majored in Fine Arts and subsequently qualified in web applications development, before retiring from the adult industry completely in 2003.
