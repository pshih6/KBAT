Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard (French: Arthur et la vengeance de Maltazard) is a 2009 English-language French animated/live-action feature film co-written, co-produced and directed by Luc Besson, based on his novel of the same title and starring Freddie Highmore and Mia Farrow. EuropaCorp produced the film, which is the second in Besson's Arthur series, following Arthur and the Invisibles. The film received generally negative reviews by critics. It was a success in France but, due to its predecessor's failure at the American box office, was released direct-to-video in the United States. It performed disappointingly in the rest of the world. As a result, the film and its sequel, Arthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds, generated huge money losses for EuropaCorp.
