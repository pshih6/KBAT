Wesleyan University ( (listen) WESS-lee-É™n) is a private university in Middletown, Connecticut. Founded in 1831 as a men's college under the auspices of the Methodist Episcopal Church and with the support of prominent residents of Middletown, the now-secular university was the first institution of higher education to be named after John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. The college became fully co-educational in 1970 after accepting female applicants from 1872 to 1909; the college's reversal on accepting women led to the establishment of Connecticut College in 1912. With Amherst and Williams Colleges, Wesleyan is one of "the Little Three" liberal arts colleges and competes athletically as a member of the NESCAC.
Wesleyan University has produced distinguished alumni in the arts and sciences, literature, politics and government, business, journalism, and academia. Its alumni include 13 Pulitzer Prize winners such as playwright and Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, 14 Rhodes scholars, three Truman scholars, three Guggenheim fellows, seven MacArthur fellows, and 156 Fulbright scholars. Additionally, four Nobel laureates have been associated with the university. Other prominent alumni include 34 members of the United States Congress, 16 presidential cabinet members, 11 governors, six directors and heads of U.S. federal agencies, several CEOs and founders of Fortune 500 companies, and two attorneys general of the United States.
