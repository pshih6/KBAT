Dmitry Yuryevich Puchkov (Russian: Дмитрий Юрьевич Пучков; born August 2, 1961), also known as Starshiy Operupolnomocheniy Goblin, is an English-to-Russian movie and video game translator, script-writer, author, and activist.  His alternative voice-over translations of famous Hollywood movies are widely known both for their perceived profanity and humour.
Puchkov's translation of the Russian gangster film Bumer is his only work on Russian movies and was the last "alternative dubbing" of his studio Bozhya Iskra. Puchkov is also a popular blogger and film reviewer.
