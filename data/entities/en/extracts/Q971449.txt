Mihailo Vojislavljević (fl. 1050–d. 1081) (Serbian: Михаило Војисављевић/Mihailo Vojislavljević) was the king of Dioclea (Duklja), from 1050 to 1081 initially as a Byzantine vassal holding the title of protospatharios, then after 1077 as nominally serving Pope Gregory VII, addressed as "King of the Slavs". He had alienated himself from the Byzantines when he supported a Byzantine Slavic revolt in 1071–72, after which he then sought to gain support in the West. In 1077 he received a royal insignia by Gregory VII in the aftermath of the Church schism of 1054.
