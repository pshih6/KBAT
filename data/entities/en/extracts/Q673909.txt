The Dreil채nderspitze is one of the higher mountains in the Silvretta range in the eastern Alps, at 3,197 metres. The borders of Graub체nden (Switzerland), Vorarlberg (Austria) and Tyrol (Austria) meet at the peak. Its name (Dreil채nderspitze means peak of three countries) refers to a meeting point between the territories of three ancient tribes (Rhaeto-Romance or Romansch, Bavarii and Alamanni) and their languages. It is also on the watershed between the Rhine and Danube. It is a favourite viewpoint, due to its position and accessibility. Its first documented ascent was by the German alpinist Theodor Petersen, accompanied by two locals, on 14 July 1870, although it appeared to have been previously climbed by surveyors in the 1850s. The nearest settlements are Galt체r, 14 km to the north, and Guarda, 9 km to the south.
