The Plot to Assassinate Hitler (German: Der 20. Juli) is a 1955 German feature film produced by CCC Film on the failed 20 July 1944 attempt to kill Adolf Hitler. Falk Harnack directed and co-wrote the film's script with GÃ¼nther Weisenborn. Wolfgang Preiss won the German Federal Film Award for his role as the rebel army officer, Claus von Stauffenberg. The film has a realism that comes close to the style of a documentary. 
The Plot to Assassinate Hitler was released in the same year as G.W. Pabst's film, Es geschah am 20. Juli, (English title, Jackboot Mutiny), which deals with the same subject.
