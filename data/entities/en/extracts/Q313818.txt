Kim Bendix Petersen (born 14 June 1956), better known by his stage name King Diamond, is a Danish rock musician and songwriter. As a vocalist, he is known for his powerful and wide ranging singing voice, in particular his far reaching falsetto screams. He is the lead vocalist and lyricist for both Mercyful Fate and the eponymous King Diamond. As well as being a vocalist, Diamond also plays keyboards and guitars on studio recordings but uses live shows to focus solely on his vocal performance. Diamond is renowned for his dark lyrical content on many of Mercyful Fate's albums as well as his story concepts for some of King Diamond's albums. Diamond is also well known for his distinctive shock stage persona (in particular his black and white facepaint). Diamond remains a huge influence on many rock and metal artists including Metallica, Slayer and Cradle of Filth
