The University of Ingolstadt was founded in 1472 by Louis the Rich, the Duke of Bavaria at the time, and its first Chancellor was the Bishop of Eichst√§tt. It consisted of five faculties: humanities, sciences, theology, law, and medicine, all of which were contained in the Hoheschule ('high school'). The university was modeled after the University of Vienna. Its chief goal was the propagation of the Christian faith.  The university closed in May 1800, by order of the Prince-elector Maximilian IV (later Maximilian I, King of Bavaria).
