Bursa is a large city in Turkey, located in northwestern Anatolia, within the Marmara Region. The fourth most populous city in Turkey and second most populous in Marmara Region, Bursa functions as one of the  industrial and trade centres of Turkey (especially in regard to the automotive industry). The city is also the capital of Bursa Province.
Bursa (Ottoman Turkish: بورسا‎) was the first major and second overall capital of the Ottoman State between 1335 and 1363. The city was referred to as Hüdavendigar (خداوندگار, from the Persian name translated as "God's gift") during the  Ottoman period, while a more recent nickname is Yeşil Bursa ("Green Bursa") in reference to the parks and gardens located across its urban fabric, as well as to the vast and richly varied forests of the surrounding region. Mount Uludağ, the ancient Mysian Olympus, towers over it, and has a well-known ski resort. Bursa has rather orderly urban growth and borders a fertile plain. The mausoleums of the early  Ottoman sultans are located in Bursa, and the city's main landmarks include numerous edifices built throughout the Ottoman period. Bursa also has thermal baths, old Ottoman mansions, palaces, and several museums.
The  shadow-play characters Karagöz and Hacivat are based on historic personalities who lived and died in Bursa (in the 14th century). The city is also known for İskender kebap, pideli köfte, cantık,  marron glacé and Bursa peaches. Bursa houses the Uludağ University, and its population can claim one of the highest overall levels of education in Turkey. The historic towns of İznik (Nicaea), Zeytinbağı (Tirilye) are near the centrum.
As of 2015 Bursa had a population of 1,854,285, and Bursa Province had 2,842,000 inhabitants.
