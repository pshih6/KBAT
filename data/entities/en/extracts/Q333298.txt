William Martin Murphy (6 January 1845 â€“ 26 June 1919) was an Irish businessman, newspaper publisher and politician.  A member of parliament (MP) representing Dublin from 1885 to 1892, he was dubbed "William Murder Murphy" among Dublin workers and the press due to the Dublin Lockout of 1913.  He was arguably both Ireland's first "press baron" and the leading promoter of tram development.
