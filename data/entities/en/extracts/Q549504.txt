Massacration is a Brazilian satirical heavy metal band, self-proclaimed the "greatest and most classic heavy metal band, the inspiration behind most heavy bands since 1985, whose members' hairdos and posing influenced the whole heavy metal culture". The classical line-up consists of Detonator (vocal, Bruno Sutter), Blondie Hammet (lead guitar, Fausto Fanti), Metal Avenger (bass guitar, Marco Antônio Alves), Jimmy "The Hammer" (drums, Felipe Torres) and Headmaster (rhythm guitar, Adriano Pereira).
Massacration was created in the sketch comedy show Hermes & Renato along with other fake bands such as the indietronica "Também Sou Hype" ("I'm Also Hype", a parody of CSS), samba school "Unidos do Caralho a Quatro" or the axé band "Coração Melão" (Melon Heart). But, like The Monkees, Massacration became a huge success, and a real band.
