Masculin Féminin (French: Masculin féminin: 15 faits précis, pronounced [maskylɛ̃ feminɛ̃ kɛ̃z fe pʁesi], "Masculine Feminine: 15 Specific Events") is a 1966 French New Wave romantic drama film directed by Jean-Luc Godard. The film, an international co-production between France and Sweden, stars Jean-Pierre Léaud, Chantal Goya, Marlène Jobert, Catherine-Isabelle Duport, and Michel Debord.Masculin Féminin is a notable film within Godard's 1960s period of filmmaking, and is considered by some critics to be representative of 1960s France and Paris. The film contains references to various pop culture icons and political figures of the time, such as Charles de Gaulle, André Malraux, James Bond, and Bob Dylan, and follows Godard's non-linear filmmaking techniques and narratives. At times the main story is interrupted by various sequences and sub-plots, including a scene paraphrased from LeRoi Jones’ Dutchman. Arguably the most famous quotation from the film is "This film could be called The Children of Marx and Coca-Cola", which is actually an intertitle between chapters.
