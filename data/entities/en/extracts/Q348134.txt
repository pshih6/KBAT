The Italia Conti Academy is a performing arts educational institution based in London, England delivering a variety of disciplines and theatre training at Secondary Education, Further Education and Higher Education.
It was founded in 1911 by the actress Italia Conti.The academy grew out of the first production of the play Where the Rainbow Ends. Italia Conti, an established actress with a reputation for her success working with young people, was asked to take over the job of training the cast.
The academy then moved to a church building in Conduit Street, however during World War II, the academy was bombed, destroying all early records. In 1972, the academy relocated to a building in Landor Road, Clapham. It was the home to all full-time Italia Conti pupils for nine years.
In 1981, the academy grew and developed so much that it had to expand to Goswell Road in the City of London where the Junior and Musical Theatre courses are run. The BA Acting and CertHe Intro to Acting programmes are still based at the Avondale site in Clapham. It is a member of the Federation of Drama Schools.
