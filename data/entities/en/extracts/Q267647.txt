Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who is a 2007 documentary by Murray Lerner and Paul Crowder about English rock and roll band The Who. The film features new interviews with band members Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle, Kenney Jones, and Pete Townshend, as well as Sting, The Edge, Noel Gallagher, Eddie Vedder, Steve Jones and others, as well as rare photos of the four members of the band, and archival live footage of performances dating back to 1964. A soundtrack accompanying the film also serves as a greatest-hits compilation for the band.
The two-DVD set includes footage not in earlier documentaries, including film from the 1970 Leeds University appearance, never-seen-before footage of a show in Copenhagen that shows Daltrey leaving the stage because the performance of the other members of The Who broke down into chaotic noise due to amphetamines – which resulted in a fight between Daltrey and Moon backstage and Daltrey being kicked out of the band temporarily – and a 1964 performance at the Railway Hotel when they were The High Numbers.
The film was nominated for a 2009 Grammy Award. An exclusive three disc set was available only at Best Buy retailers with a third disc featuring the majority of their performance on 8 December 1979 at Chicago's International Amphitheatre.
