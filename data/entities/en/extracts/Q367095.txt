Murilo Rubião (1 June 1916 – 16 September 1991) was a Brazilian writer. His entire work consists of short stories, best described as surreal fables in the tradition of Franz Kafka - this being so, Rubião's work must be seen as part of the Magic Realism movement of late 20th-century Latin America.  It is said that Rubião was obsessive about his work, revising it at every new edition, always changing a few details, such as characters' names.
