The Korean Empire (transcripted as Daehan Jeguk, Korean: 대한제국; Hanja: 大韓帝國, lit. 'Great Korean Empire') was the last independent unified Korean state. Proclaimed in October 1897 by Emperor Gojong of the Joseon dynasty, the empire stood until Japan's annexation of Korea in August 1910. During the Korean Empire, Emperor Gojong oversaw the Gwangmu Reform, a partial modernization and Westernization of the military, economy, land system, and education system, and of various industries. In 1905, Korea was made a colonial protectorate of Japan and in 1910 it was annexed by the country outright.
