Sir Marc Isambard Brunel  (, French: [maʁk izɑ̃baʁ bʁynɛl]; 25 April 1769 – 12 December 1849) was an English engineer. He is best known for the construction of the Thames Tunnel and as the father of Isambard Kingdom Brunel.
Born in France, Brunel fled to the United States during the French Revolution. In 1796, he was appointed Chief Engineer of New York City. He moved to London in 1799, where he married Sophia Kingdom. In addition to the construction of the Thames Tunnel, his work as a mechanical engineer included the design of machinery to automate the production of pulley blocks for the Royal Navy.
Brunel preferred the given name Isambard, but is generally known to history as Marc to avoid confusion with his more famous son.
