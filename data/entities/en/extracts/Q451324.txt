Highpoint is a Canadian 1982 action comedy-thriller film directed by Peter Carter and starring Richard Harris, Christopher Plummer and Beverly D'Angelo.
The film was shot on location in Montreal and Toronto, and is perhaps best remembered for its climax atop CN Tower, in which stuntman Dar Robinson (doubling for Plummer) makes the 700-foot jump in freefall, protected only by a hidden parachute. The film underwent a lengthy and troubled post-production period. Originally filmed in 1979 as a comedic thriller in the vein of  North by Northwest, the film was shelved for two years during which extensive reshoots took place. The film was given a limited release in Europe in 1982. Due to negative critical and audience reception concerning its convoluted plot and poor pacing, the film was heavily re-edited by North American distributor New World Pictures, removing much of the comedy and replacing John Addison's original score with one by Christopher Young. This version was released in theaters in 1984, and provided the basis for future home video releases.
