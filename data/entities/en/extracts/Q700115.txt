Lifeforce Records is a German heavy metal independent record label that specializes in metalcore and death metal. Their roster contains bands such as Confession, This or the Apocalypse, Omnium Gatherum and Last Leaf Down, and they have helped to launch the careers of bands who went on to larger labels, such as Heaven Shall Burn, Between the Buried and Me, Caliban and Trivium.
While Lifeforce has signed and continues to sign both European and American artists, they announced in October 2002 that they were going to shift focus away from the latter following the breakup of Endthisday and Beyond the Sixth Seal, as well as Between the Buried and Me (who were at the time one of their most successful bands) leaving the label for Victory Records.
