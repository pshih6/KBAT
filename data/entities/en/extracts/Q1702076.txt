John Wesley Snyder (June 21, 1895 â€“ October 8, 1985) was an American businessman and senior federal government official. Thanks to a close personal friendship with President Harry S Truman, he became Secretary of the Treasury in the Truman administration. He is the first native-born Arkansan to hold a US Cabinet post. Historian Alonzo Hamby emphasizes Snyder's conservatism, stating that he was openly skeptical of New Dealism, broad-gauged social programs, and intellectuals who believed the economy could be run from Washington.
