In 2003, he wrote he was no longer able to support the American conservative movement, as he was disaffected with the Republican Party's continued rightward drift on social issues during the George W. Bush era.Born and raised in Britain, he has lived in the United States since 1984 and currently resides in Washington, D.C. and Provincetown, Massachusetts.
