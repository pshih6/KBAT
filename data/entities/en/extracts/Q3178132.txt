Dabayin Min (Burmese: ဒီပဲယင်းမင်), commonly known as Naungdawgyi (Burmese: နောင်တော်ကြီး [nàʊɰ̃dɔ̀dʑí]; 10 August 1736 – 28 November 1763) was the second king of Konbaung Dynasty of Burma (Myanmar), from 1760 to 1763. He was a top military commander in his father Alaungpaya's reunification campaigns of the country. As king, he spent much of his short reign suppressing multiple rebellions across the newly founded kingdom from Ava (Inwa) and Toungoo (Taungoo) to Martaban (Mottama) and Chiang Mai. The king suddenly died less than a year after he had successfully suppressed the rebellions. He was succeeded by his younger brother Hsinbyushin.
