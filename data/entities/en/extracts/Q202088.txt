The London Borough of Camden is a borough in Inner London, and historically a part of Middlesex. Camden Town Hall, on Euston Road, lies 1.4 miles north of Charing Cross.
Most of the borough is seen as part of north London, but the boroughâ€™s southern (more central) areas of Bloomsbury and Holborn are sometimes described as part of the West End of London. The local authority is Camden London Borough Council.
