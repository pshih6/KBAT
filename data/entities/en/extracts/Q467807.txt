The Magical Legend of the Leprechauns is a 1999 Hallmark Entertainment made-for-TV fantasy movie that was originally broadcast on NBC. It stars Randy Quaid, Colm Meaney, Kieran Culkin, Roger Daltrey, Caroline Carver and Whoopi Goldberg. The film contains two main stories that eventually intertwine: the first being the story of an American businessman who visits Ireland and encounters magical leprechauns and the second, a story of a pair of star-crossed lovers who happen to be a fairy and a leprechaun, belonging to opposing sides of a magical war. It contains many references to Romeo and Juliet such as two lovers taking poison and feuding clans.
Emma Townshend's song "We Can Fly Away" was the theme song for the film.
