Johann Carl Kaiserling (February 3, 1869 - August 20, 1942) was a German pathologist who was a native of Kassel-Wehlheiden.
He studied medicine in Munich, Kiel and Berlin, earning his medical doctorate in 1893. In 1902 he became privatdozent at the University of Berlin, and from 1912 was a professor of general pathology and pathological anatomy at the University of KÃ¶nigsberg.
His name is associated with "Kaiserling's fixative", a means of preserving histologic and pathologic specimens without changing the natural color. This fixative is an aqueous solution of formalin, potassium nitrate and potassium acetate. Kaiserling is also known for his pioneer work in the field of photomicrography.
