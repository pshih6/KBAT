Louis Burton Lindley Jr. (June 29, 1919 â€“ December 8, 1983), better known by his stage name Slim Pickens, was an American rodeo performer and film and television actor. For much of his career Pickens played mainly cowboy roles; he is perhaps best remembered today for his comic roles in Dr. Strangelove, Blazing Saddles and 1941.
