Gaston Tissandier (November 21, 1843 â€“ August 30, 1899) was a French chemist, meteorologist, aviator and editor. Adventurer could be added to the list of his titles, as he managed to escape besieged Paris by balloon in September 1870. He founded and edited the scientific magazine La Nature and wrote several books.
His brother was illustrator Albert Tissandier. His son Paul became a well known aviator in his own right.
