Al Copley (born Alman LeGrande Copley, 1952, Buffalo, New York) is a blues pianist who co-founded the American jump blues band Roomful of Blues with guitarist Duke Robillard in Westerly, Rhode Island in 1967. In 1974 Count Basie called Roomful "the hottest blues band I've ever heard". In 1975 Roomful signed a recording contract with Island Records, thanks to support from Doc Pomus. After 16 years and 7 albums with Roomful, Copley relocated to Europe in 1984, where he still travels and performs extensively.
Strongly influenced by the music of Big Joe Turner, Copley's solo style spans several genres and defies categorisation, including (but certainly not limited to) swing, boogie-woogie and barrelhouse. Live performances are characterised by their energy and Copley's acrobatic approach to piano performance, in the style of Jerry Lee Lewis.
Copley has performed and recorded with Lou Rawls, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Ruth Brown, Jimmy Witherspoon, Snooks Eaglin, John Hammond Jr., Big Mama Thornton, George "Harmonica" Smith, Otis Rush, Big Walter Horton, Helen Humes, Benny Waters, Hal Singer, Arnett Cobb, Scott Hamilton, Big Jay McNeely, Roy "Good Rockin" Brown and a host of others.
