Christ's Hospital, also known colloquially as CH, is an English coeducational independent day and boarding school with Royal Charter located to the south of Horsham in West Sussex. Founded in 1552 and received its first Royal Charter in 1553, Christ's Hospital follows much of the public schools tradition. Since its establishment, Christ's Hospital has been a charity school, with a core aim to offer children from humble backgrounds the chance of a better education.
