Jürgen Wagner (9 September 1901 in Strasbourg – 27 June 1947 in Belgrade) was a Brigadeführer in the Waffen-SS during World War II, the commander of the SS Division Nederland and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves.
In April 1944 Wagner was promoted to SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS and given command of the 4th SS Polizei Division. In August 1944, Wagner was given command of a Kampfgruppe (battle group), against the Tartu Offensive of the Soviet 3rd Baltic Front.After the war ended, Wagner was extradited to Yugoslavia in 1947. There, he was put on trial before the military tribunal of the 3rd Yugoslav Army from 29 May to 6 June 1947 in Zrenjanin. It is not precisely known for what he was indicted. However, his orders for the mass executions of civilians in 1941 and later on, reportedly played a role in his conviction. Found guilty of the charges, he was sentenced to death by firing squad and executed on 27 June 1947.
