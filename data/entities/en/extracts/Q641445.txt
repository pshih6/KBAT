Copenhagen Records is a Danish record label formed on 5 January 2004 by former EMI Recorded Music Denmark staff members to give artists more artistic autonomy. It houses artists spread over a wide range of genres, from rock to rap, and from pop artists to comedians.
In September 2011, Universal Music Group acquires Copenhagen Records, along with the rest of MBO Group. The label operates as one of UMG's standalone labels.
