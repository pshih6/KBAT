Kar(e)l Faustin Klostermann (February 13, 1848, in Haag am Hausruck, Upper Austria, Austrian Empire – July 17, 1923, in Štěkeň, Czechoslovakia) was a Czech and Austrian writer. He wrote under the alias Faustin.
From 1857 to 1865 he went to school in Písek, a town in the South Bohemian Region of what is now the Czech Republic. He studied medicine until 1869 in Vienna, and was later active as a teacher of German and French at the German high school in Plzeň. He first wrote his works in German; later he turned to the Czech language and wrote novellas about the inhabitants of the middle Bohemian Forest (Czech: Šumava, German: Böhmerwald). This can be found in the collection V srdci šumavských hvozdů ("In the heart of the Šumava"). Some of his novellas are set in and around the town of Kašperské Hory.
Some of his more popular works include The son of the free judge and Fist in stories.
