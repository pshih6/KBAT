Dietrich Richard Alfred von Hildebrand (12 October 1889 â€“ 26 January 1977) was a German Roman Catholic philosopher and theologian.
Hildebrand was called "the twentieth-century Doctor of the Church" by Pope Pius XII. Pope John Paul II also greatly admired the work of Hildebrand, remarking once to his widow, Alice von Hildebrand, "Your husband is one of the great ethicists of the twentieth century." Benedict XVI also has a particular admiration and regard for Hildebrand, whom he knew as a young priest in Munich. The degree of Pope Benedict's esteem is expressed in one of his statements about Hildebrand: "When the intellectual history of the Catholic Church in the twentieth century is written, the name of Dietrich von Hildebrand will be most prominent among the figures of our time."
A vocal critic of the changes in the church brought by the Second Vatican Council, Hildebrand became vice director of Luigi Villa's Chiesa viva ("Living Church") He was especially critical of the new liturgy and helped to promote appreciation of and attendance at the traditional Mass.
