Hugo Cores (November 7, 1937â€“December 7, 2006) was an influential Uruguayan political activist.
Born in Villa Crespo, Argentina, Cores was a target of Operation Condor, a campaign of assassination and intelligence-gathering among South American governments in the mid-1970s. He avoided assassination, however, and became the last surviving core member of the Partido por la Victoria del Pueblo, before his death in 2006.
His remains are buried in the Cementerio del Buceo, Montevideo.
