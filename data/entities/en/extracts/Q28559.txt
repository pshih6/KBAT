In 1896, he invented and perfected the flash boiler, which made steam a much more practical source of power for an automobile.Serpollet was born in the Ain department of France, and went on to establish his factory on the rue des Cloÿs in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, a location that has become the Parc Léon Serpollet today.He held the World land speed record, at 75.06 miles per hour (120.80 km/h), achieved in April 1902 driving the steam powered Gardner-Serpollet Oeuf de Pacques ('Easter Egg').He is commemorated by a statue by Jean Boucher at the Place Saint-Ferdinand (48.877969°N 2.288112°E﻿ / 48.877969; 2.288112) in Paris' 17th arrondissement, and the Parc Léon Serpollet (48.89228°N 2.33831°E﻿ / 48.89228; 2.33831) in its 18th arrondissement.
