Nonfiction or non-fiction is any document, or content that purports in good faith to represent truth and accuracy regarding information, events, or people.  Nonfiction content may be presented either objectively or subjectively, and may sometimes take the form of a story.  Nonfiction is one of the fundamental divisions of narrative (specifically, prose) writingâ€” in contrast to fiction, which offers information, events, or characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary, or else leaves open if and how the work refers to reality.Nonfiction's specific factual assertions and descriptions may or may not be accurate, and can give either a true or a false account of the subject in question. However, authors of such accounts genuinely believe or claim them to be truthful at the time of their composition or, at least, pose them to a convinced audience as historically or empirically factual. Reporting the beliefs of others in a nonfiction format is not necessarily an endorsement of the veracity of those beliefs, but rather an exercise in representing the topic (for example, mythology). Most literary criticism is a form of nonfiction, providing information and analysis about works of fiction. Nonfiction need not necessarily be written text, since pictures and film can also purport to present a factual account of a subject.
