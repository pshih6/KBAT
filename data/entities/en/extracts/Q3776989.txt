The Cementerio Presbítero Matías Maestro is a cemetery in Lima, the capital city of Peru.  It is also a museum, though attempts to make it a museum exclusively have failed. The architectural styles of the mausoleums found within are broad ranging. It houses the remains of several important political, military and literary figures. Most prominent of all the mausoleums is the Panteón de los Próceres where heroes of the War of the Pacific (1879–1884) are buried. The mausoleum's entrance reads "La Nación a sus Defensores" (Meaning "The Nation, to its Defenders").
