Mary Miles Minter (born Juliet Reilly, April 25, 1902â€“ August 4, 1984) was an American actress. She appeared in 53 silent era films from 1912 to 1923.
In 1922, Minter was involved in a scandal surrounding the murder of director William Desmond Taylor, for whom she professed her love. Although gossip implicated her mother, former actress Charlotte Shelby, as the murderer, Minter's reputation was tarnished, and she gave up her movie career in 1923.
