The Escola Politécnica of the University of São Paulo (or the Engineering School of the University of São Paulo, Portuguese: Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo) (usually called Poli, Poli-USP or EPUSP) is an engineering school at the University of São Paulo (USP) in São Paulo, Brazil.
It was founded in 1893 - before the creation of USP itself - and was the first engineering school in the state of São Paulo. Its original name was "Escola Politécnica de São Paulo". It was incorporated by USP in 1934. Its students are known as "politécnicos".
Since many graduates from the Escola Politécnica have, throughout Brazilian history, occupied positions with public exposure and/or business and industry leadership, including ten mayors of São Paulo and six state governors, it has a reputation of "training leaders". The Escola Politécnica is part of the University of São Paulo, widely regarded as one of the best higher education institutions in Latin America, but has acquired a reputation in its own right, having its civil, electrical, mechanical, and chemical engineering courses ranked as the best in the country in 2014.Internationally, along with the other engineering schools of USP (São Carlos School of Engineering and Lorena School of Engineering), the Escola Politécnica was ranked among the top 100 engineering schools worldwide by Academic Ranking of World Universities. Its computer science, chemical, civil, electrical/electronic and mechanical engineering departments were also ranked in the top 100 worldwide in the QS World University Rankings. The school offers numerous double-degree and open exchange programs for its students, celebrating in 2015 its 1,000th double diploma between USP and its partner universities.
