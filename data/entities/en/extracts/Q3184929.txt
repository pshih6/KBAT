Jean Joseph Léon Farcot (23 June 1824 – 19 March 1908) was a French engineer and industrialist whose factories employed up to 700 workers. He was also a prolific inventor.
He was one of the pioneers of the servomechanism, where a feedback loop helps control a machine.
The invention lets one helmsman control a ship's rudder weighing several tons.
