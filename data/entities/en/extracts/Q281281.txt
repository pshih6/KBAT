Eyes of an Angel is a 1991 American drama film starring John Travolta and directed by Robert Harmon. It was released in France, Sweden, and on television in the United States as The Tender.  It was released straight-to-video in 1994 under its proper title to coincide with Travolta's bigger name release, Pulp Fiction.  According to the opening credits, the movie is based on a true story.  The film was shot predominantly in Chicago with some pickups and reshoots in Los Angeles.
Travolta plays Bobby Allen, a down-on-his-luck single father and recovering alcoholic whose wife died of a drug overdose.  With no job and no money, his former brother-in-law Cissy gets him a job as a money courier while Bobby's 10-year-old daughter finds a wounded fighting dog.  She takes care of the dog over her father's objections, until Bobby is betrayed by Cissy, who blames him for his sister's death.  Desperate, Bobby steals Cissy's money and flees with the girl to California, leaving the dog behind.  The dog follows them across the country to be reunited with the girl, while Cissy pursues Bobby to retrieve his money and to take the girl.
