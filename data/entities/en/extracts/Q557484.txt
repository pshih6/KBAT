Konrad V Kantner (ca. 1385 – 10 September 1439) was a duke of Oleśnica, Koźle, half of Bytom and half of Ścinawa during 1412–1427 (with his brothers as co-rulers), since 1427 sole ruler over Oleśnica.
He was the second son of Konrad III the Old, Duke of Oleśnica, by his wife Judith. Like his one older and three younger brothers, at the baptism he received the name of Konrad, which was characteristic in this branch of the House of Piast. His nickname of Kantner was derived from the town of Kanth (pl: Kąty Wrocławskie), who was a property of the Oleśnica dukes since 1379.
