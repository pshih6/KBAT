Daisy Earles (April 29, 1907 â€“ March 15, 1980) was a German dwarf who migrated to the United States in the early 1920s. She worked in Hollywood films in California and later toured with circus companies. Daisy Earles was blonde, pretty, and tall compared to her other sisters, and had a very well proportioned figure, for which she earned the epithet of a "miniature Mae West". Her circus acts with her siblings were as "parade performers".
