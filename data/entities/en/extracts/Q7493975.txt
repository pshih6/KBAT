Shelter Records was a U.S. record label started by Leon Russell and Denny Cordell that operated from 1969 to 1981.  The company established offices in both Los Angeles and Tulsa, Russell's home town, where the label sought to promote a "workshop atmosphere" with a recording studio in a converted church, adjoining houses for artists working at the studio, and other facilities. The Tulsa recording studio was housed in the historic The Church Studio.  Russell remained with Shelter until 1976, when he and Cordell fell out.  In a settlement, Cordell then became sole owner of the label, while Russell left to start his own label, Paradise Records.In addition to Russell, the label signed other talents, such as Tulsa Sound artists J. J. Cale, Dwight Twilley Band and the Gap Band,  as well as Alan Gerber, Jesse Barish (of Jesse, Wolff and Whings), Don Nix, Freddie King, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Phoebe Snow, Richard Torrance and Eureka, Willis Alan Ramsey, and the Grease Band.Shelter Records also released "Duppy Conqueror", the first American single by reggae artist Bob Marley.
