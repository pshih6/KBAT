Fantozzi is a 1975 Italian satirical cult film, based on 1970 novel of the same name in the saga of the unlucky Italian clerk Ugo Fantozzi, written and played by his creator Paolo Villaggio.
The film is a parody of middle class workers of the 1970s, unhappy and frustrated at work and with family, and is known for its use of surreal humor and for several scenes which have entered popular culture.
The success of this movie rendered it a cult film that topped IT box office on sales for eight months. In the decades since its release, the film's reputation has remained almost unmutated, launching Paolo Villaggio's career. Its success led to a franchise of nine sequels, from 1976 to 1999.
