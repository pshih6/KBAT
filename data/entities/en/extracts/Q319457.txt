The Free-minded People's Party (German: Freisinnige Volkspartei) or Radical People's Party was a social liberal party in the German Empire, founded as a result of the split of the German Free-minded Party in 1893. One of its most notable members was Eugen Richter, who was party leader from 1893 to 1906. The party advocated liberalism, social progressivism and parliamentarism.
On 6 March 1910, the party merged with the Free-minded Union and the German People's Party to form the Progressive People's Party.
