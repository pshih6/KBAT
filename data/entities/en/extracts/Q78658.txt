Franz Kutschera (22 February 1904 â€“ 1 February 1944) was an Austrian Nazi politician and government official. He held numerous political and military positions with the Nazi Party and the Schutzstaffel (SS) both before and after the German Anschluss of Austria in 1938. During World War II he served with the SS in France, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.
In 1943 he was appointed SS and Police Leader in German-occupied Warsaw, the capital of Poland. Due to his crimes against Poles - including Polish Jews - the Polish resistance Home Army, in agreement with the Polish government in exile, targeted him for assassination. He was gunned down by the Poles in front of the SS headquarters in Warsaw in a special operation by Kedyw, a dedicated Polish special operations unit.
In reprisal, the Nazis murdered 300 Polish civilians.
