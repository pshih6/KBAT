Ahmed Huber (1927 – 15 May 2008) was a Swiss German journalist, and a convert to Islam, who was active in both Islamist and Far Right politics. He gained international notoriety in 2001 when he was accused by the United States government of funding Al Qaeda's terrorist activities through the Al Taqwa Bank, of which he was one of five managers.
Born Albert Friedrich Armand Huber in Fribourg, Huber was raised in a staunchly Protestant family.A member of the Swiss Socialist Party, Huber was a strong supporter of Algerian independence during the Algerian War and, whilst covering the conflict as a journalist, he opened contact with rebel groups. Through this connection he became interested in Islam and embraced the religion. He recited his first public Shahada in Geneva's Islamic Centre before making a more public declaration at Al-Azhar University in February 1962.Returning to Switzerland, he made contact with François Genoud and his association with the rightist financier in anti-Israeli activities saw him expelled from the Socialist Party. He soon became involved in extreme right politics, spending much of his time in Germany, where he was close to the National Democratic Party of Germany and smaller neo-Nazi groups, regularly speaking at conferences and seminars. An outspoken admirer of Ayatollah Khomeini, he declared the Iranian leader to be the "living continuation of Adolf Hitler" as part of his attempts to link the European far right to radical Islamism.Having forged links with the Muslim Brotherhood, Huber became involved in the Al Taqwa Bank in Switzerland. In this role he was listed by United States intelligence as a funder of terrorism in November 2001.He was a figure in Holocaust denial, providing funding to Jürgen Graf and Ahmed Rami and maintaining close links with the Institute for Historical Review, being involved in their ultimately failed attempt to host an international Holocaust Denial Conference in Lebanon in 2001.
