The University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) is a public land-grant research university in Paradise, Nevada. The 332-acre (134 ha) campus is about 1.6 mi (2.6 km) east of the Las Vegas Strip. It was formerly part of the University of Nevada from 1957 to 1969. The university includes the Shadow Lane Campus, just east of the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, which houses both School of Medicine and School of Dental Medicine. UNLV's law school, the William S. Boyd School of Law, is also the only law school in the state.
UNLV is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities - Very high research activity". The William F. Harrah College of Hotel Administration is annually ranked among the top hospitality programs in the United States due in part to the university's proximity to the Las Vegas Strip. Its Thomas & Mack Center hosted the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, concerts and lectures by Bill Clinton and Mikhail Gorbachev as part of various UNLV-affiliated lecture series.
