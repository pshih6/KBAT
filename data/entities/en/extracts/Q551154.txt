Delmar Drew Arnaud (born May 25, 1973), of the stage name Daz Dillinger, formerly Dat Nigga Daz, and commonly Daz, is an American rapper and record producer who, in the 1990s, at Death Row Records, aided the catapult of West Coast rap and gangsta rap into the mainstream. Along with Kurupt, he also forms a rap duo, Tha Dogg Pound.
Daz learned production from Dr. Dre in working on Dre's debut solo album, The Chronic, in 1992. Daz did more on Snoop Dogg's debut solo album Doggystyle in 1993, and secured his production standing on 2Pac's All Eyez on Me in 1996. Since leaving Death Row around 2000, Daz has focused on his own, indie releases through his D.P.G. Recordz.
