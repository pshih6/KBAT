St Catherine's College (also known as Catz) is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in Oxford, England and is the youngest college to teach both undergraduate and graduate students. Tracing its roots back to 1868 (although the college itself was opened in 1962), it has 502 undergraduate and 442 graduate students as of December 2017, making it the largest undergraduate college by membership in the University of Oxford (Kellogg College has 1139 students compared to St. Catherine's 992, though it is a graduate-only college).The college developed out of the university's Delegacy for Unattached Students, and was founded in 1962 by the historian Alan Bullock, who went on to become the first master of the college, and later vice-chancellor of the university.
