He experienced a sort of conversion to Western learning when he learned that the comet of 1910 had been identified as a reappearance of Halley's comet.  He abandoned his clerical training after this event and enrolled in the American Memorial School of Tabriz. Thenceforward he became, in Roy Mottahedeh's words, "a true anti-cleric."Kasravi was associated with the Democrat Party in Iran.Kasravi was a professor of law at the University of Tehran and also a lawyer in Tehran, Iran. He was the founder of a political-social movement whose goal was to build an Iranian secular identity. The movement was formed during the Pahlavi dynasty.
Kasravi authored more than 70 books, mostly in the Persian language. The most important ones are "History of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution" and "Eighteen Years History of Azerbaijan", which are the among the most important literature works of the Persian Constitutional Revolution.
