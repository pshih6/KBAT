Fabien Marsaud (born 31 July 1977 in Le Blanc-Mesnil, Seine-Saint-Denis), better known by his stage name Grand Corps Malade (also abbreviated GCM), is a French slam poet and lyricist, known for his low voice and for releasing songs and albums on which he slams over music.
His stage name means "Tall Sick Body" in French, a reference to his height (nearly 6'4" or 1.95m) and to a spine injury that forces him to walk with a crutch, due to a 1997 accident that originally had doctors tell him he would never walk again.
