By the mid-1940s, many of his writings were included in the curricula of schools, colleges and universities.Even though most of his observations and criticism were leveled at the Muslim world, Qutb is also known for his intense disapproval of the society and culture of the United States, which he saw as materialistic, and obsessed with violence and sexual pleasures.
He advocated violent, offensive jihad. 
Qutb has been described by followers as a great thinker and martyr for Islam, while many Western observers (and some Muslims) see him as a key originator of Islamist ideology. and an inspiration for violent Islamist groups such as al-Qaeda.
