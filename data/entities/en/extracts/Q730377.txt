Vasiliy Gavrilovich Grabin (Russian: Василий Гаврилович Грабин; 9 January [O.S. 28 December 1899] 1900 – 18 April 1980) was a Soviet artillery designer.  He led a design bureau (TsAKB) at Joseph Stalin Factory No. 92 in Gorky (Nizhny Novgorod).
Grabin was chief designer of ZiS-3, the 76.2 mm (3.00 in) divisional field gun, which was the most numerous cannon of World War II (over 103,000 cannons were built).
Grabin was the first who used ergonomics in cannon construction (before the word ergonomics appears). In the 1930s he used physiologist consultation to optimize the design of cannons.
