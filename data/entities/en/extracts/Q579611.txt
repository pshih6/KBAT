Haverford College ( HAV-ər-fərd) is a private liberal arts college in Haverford, Pennsylvania. All students of the college are undergraduates and nearly all reside on campus. The college was founded in 1833 by area members of the Orthodox Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) to ensure an education grounded in Quaker values for young Quaker men. Although the college no longer has a formal religious affiliation, Quaker philosophy still influences campus life.
Originally an all-male institution, Haverford began admitting female transfer students in the 1970s and became fully co-educational in 1980. Currently, more than half of Haverford's students are women. For most of the 20th century, Haverford's total enrollment was kept below 300, but the school went through two periods of expansion during and after the 1970s, and its enrollment, as of 2018, was 1,353 students. The college offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in 31 majors across humanities, social sciences and natural sciences.
Haverford College is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, which allows students to register for courses at both Bryn Mawr College and Swarthmore College. It is also a member of the Quaker Consortium which allows students to cross-register at the University of Pennsylvania. The college has produced, among others, 4 Nobel Prize recipients, 6 Pulitzer Prize recipients, 20 Rhodes Scholars, and 38 Fulbright Scholars.
