A psychologist studies normal and abnormal mental states, perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and social processes and behavior by experimenting with, and observing, interpreting, and recording how individuals relate to one another and to their environments. Most psychologists need a license to practice psychology. Typically, psychologists need a doctoral degree in psychology, although a master's degree is sufficient in some situations. Licensing and regulations can vary by country and profession.
Psychologists can work in applied or academic settings. Academic psychologists educate higher-education students as well as conduct research, with graduate-level research being an important part of academic psychology. Academic positions can be tenured or non-tenured, with tenured positions being highly desirable. Applied psychology applies theory to solve problems in human and animal behavior. Clinical psychology and Counseling psychology are two fields of applied psychology that focus on therapeutic methods. Other applied fields such as industrial and organizational psychology, forensic psychology, and others, aim to solve problems in business, government, industry, and similar fields.
