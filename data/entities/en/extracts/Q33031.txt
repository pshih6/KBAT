Vojislav Koštunica (Serbian Cyrillic: Војислав Коштуница, pronounced [ʋǒjislaʋ koʃtǔnit͡sa] (listen); born 24 March 1944) is a former Serbian politician. He was the last president of Yugoslavia from 2000 to 2003, and the prime minister of Serbia in two terms (from 2004 to 2007, and from 2007 to 2008).Koštunica won the 2000 Yugoslavian presidential election as a candidate of a wide alliance Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), which led to overthrow of Slobodan Milošević and withdrawal of international sanctions against FR Yugoslavia. He strictly opposed the cooperation with International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and his party left the coalition government in protest of a decision to extradite Slobodan Milošević to the ICTY. After the 2003 Serbian parliamentary election, the first elections after the dissolution of DOS and assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić, Koštunica formed the minority government with the support of the Milošević's Socialist Party of Serbia and became the head of government. He was one of the crucial figures for the adoption of the first constitution of an independent Serbia, as well as for declaring Serbia a neutral country. During his second government, he opposed signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), leading to the fall of the government after a year and early elections won by pro-European parties.
He was one of the founders and the first president of the Democratic Party of Serbia since its creation in 1992 until 19 March 2014, when he resigned as party president and retired from active politics after his party failed to reach 5% threshold to enter the Parliament on March 16 elections for the first time in its history. In October 2014, he left the party after disagreements with new party leadership over what he saw as their abandonment of the policy of political neutrality.In November 2014, he was one of the founders of Statehood Movement of Serbia.
