Faust is a 1994 film directed by Jan Švankmajer. It merges live-action footage with stop-motion animation and includes puppetry and claymation. The film was produced by Jaromír Kallista and the title character is played by Petr Čepek. The film does not relate the legend of Faustus accurately according to the original, instead borrowing and blending elements from the story as told by Goethe and Christopher Marlowe with traditional folk renditions. It has elements of Modernism and Absurdism, and has a Kafkaesque atmosphere, enhanced by being set in Prague, and the tone is dark but humorous. The voices in the English version were provided by Andrew Sachs. The film was selected as the Czech entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 67th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.
