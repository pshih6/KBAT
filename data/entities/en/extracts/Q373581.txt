Garcia de Resende (1470 – 3 February 1536) was a Portuguese poet and editor. He served John II as a page and private secretary. After John's death, he continued to enjoy the same favour with Manuel I, whom he accompanied to Castile in 1498, and from whom he obtained a knighthood in the Order of Christ.In 1514, Resende went to Rome with Tristão da Cunha, as secretary and treasurer of the embassy sent by the king to offer tribute to Pope Leo X. In 1516 he was given the rank of a nobleman of the royal household, and became escrivão de fazenda to Prince John, afterwards King John III, from whom he received further pensions in 1525.Resende built a chapel in the monastery of Espinheiro near Évora, the pantheon of the Alentejo nobility, where he was buried.
