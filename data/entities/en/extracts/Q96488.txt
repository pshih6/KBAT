Alexander Hermann Graf von Wartensleben (16 December 1650 in Bad Lippspringe â€“ 26 January 1734 in Berlin) was an officer in the armies of various German states, a Prussian Generalfeldmarschall and a member of the Cabinet of Three Counts with August David zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein and Johann Kasimir Kolbe von Wartenberg - due to their heavy taxation, this was also known as the "three great W(oes)" of Prussia (Wartenberg, Wartensleben, Wittgenstein).
