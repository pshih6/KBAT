Detlev Karsten Rohwedder (16 October 1932 – 1 April 1991) was a German manager and politician, as member of the Social Democratic Party. He was manager of the Treuhandanstalt.
Rohwedder was born in Gotha. While responsible for the privatisation of state-owned property in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), he was assassinated by a sniper while standing at the window of his house in Düsseldorf. The West German far-left militant group Red Army Faction (RAF) has claimed responsibility for this act, but the shooter has never been identified.
