Map of the Human Heart (also called Carte du Tendre and La Carte du Tendre; released in the Philippines as War Dragon) is a 1992 film by New Zealand director Vincent Ward. The script for Map of the Human Heart was written by Australian author Louis Nowra, using a 10-page treatment Ward had written a year earlier as his guide. Ward was originally intended at this time to be directing his script of the third film in the Alien series, but his dismissal from the sci fi project (leaving him credited solely as providing the story) led to his helming this film instead.
Map of the Human Heart, set mostly before and during the Second World War, centres on the life of Avik, a Canadian Inuit boy. The film stars Robert Joamie and Jason Scott Lee as the youth and adult Avik. His love, Albertine (played as a child by Annie Galipeau and as an adult by Anne Parillaud) is countered by the imposing Walter Russell (Patrick Bergin), who plays a pivotal role as both surrogate father to Avik and his primary rival in Albertine's love. Jeanne Moreau has a minor role as a Québécois nun. John Cusack also has a small but important role as the mapmaker to whom Avik relates his incredible tale.
