The Plastic Ono Band was a rock band formed by John Lennon and Yoko Ono in 1969 for their collaborative and solo projects.
Lennon and Ono began a personal and artistic relationship in 1968, collaborating on several experimental releases. Following their marriage in 1969, they decided their future endeavours would be credited to a conceptual and collaborative vehicle, Plastic Ono Band. The band featured a rotating lineup of musicians including Eric Clapton, Klaus Voormann, Alan White, Billy Preston, Jim Keltner, Keith Moon, Delaney & Bonnie and Friends, and Lennon's former Beatles bandmates George Harrison and Ringo Starr. After the Lennons' move to New York, they collaborated with Elephant's Memory under the moniker of the "Plastic Ono Elephant's Memory Band". Lennon's collaborations continued under similar names, until the winding down of the concept in 1974.
From 2009â€“2015 (29 years following the death of Lennon in 1980), Ono and her son Sean Lennon led a new incarnation of the group, the Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band.
