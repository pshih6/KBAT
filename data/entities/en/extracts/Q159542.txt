Jan Evangelista Purkyně (Czech: [ˈjan ˈɛvaŋɡɛlɪsta ˈpurkɪɲɛ] (listen); also written Johann Evangelist Purkinje) (17 or 18 December 1787 – 28 July 1869) was a Czech anatomist and physiologist. In 1839, he coined the term 'protoplasm' for the fluid substance of a cell. He was one of the best known scientists of his time. Such was his fame that when people from outside Europe wrote letters to him, all that they needed to put as the address was "Purkyně, Europe".
