Count János Eszterházy (Hungarian: [ˈjaːnoʃ ˈɛstɛrhaːzi]; rarely Slovak: Ján Esterházi; March 14, 1901 – March 8, 1957) was a prominent ethnic Hungarian politician in inter-war Czechoslovakia and later in the First Slovak Republic. He was a member of the Czechoslovak Parliament and of the Slovak Assembly. After the Second World War, he was illegally deported to the Soviet Union, sentenced on trumped-up charges at a show trial, and imprisoned.  In the meantime he was sentenced, in absentia, to death by the National Court in Bratislava on the charges of High Treason to the State, collaboration with enemy, the breaking-up of Czechoslovakia, and his participation in an anti-democratic regime as a deputy of the Slovak Assembly. The sentence was not executed as a consequence of a Presidential pardon, following his return to Czechoslovakia from Soviet Union. He died in prison in 1957.
The Federation of Hungarian Jewish Communities have described him as a hero for saving Jews during World War II. On the other hand, the Federation of the Jewish Communities in Slovakia have publicly criticised János Esterházy and rejected efforts to present him as "democratic, antifascist fighter and fearless savior of Jews".
