Brompton Cemetery is a London cemetery in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, managed by The Royal Parks. It is one of the Magnificent Seven cemeteries. Established by Act of Parliament and laid out in 1839, it opened in 1840, originally as the West of London and Westminster Cemetery. Consecrated by Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London in June 1840, it is one of Britain's oldest and most distinguished garden cemeteries. Some 35,000 monuments, from simple headstones to substantial mausolea, mark more than 205,000 resting places. The site includes large plots for family mausolea, and common graves where coffins are piled deep into the earth. It also has a small columbarium, and a secluded Garden of Remembrance at the northern end for cremated remains. It is also known as an urban haven for nature. It was awarded a National Lottery grant to carry out essential restoration and develop a visitor centre, among other improvements.
It is the only cemetery in the country to be owned by the Crown.
