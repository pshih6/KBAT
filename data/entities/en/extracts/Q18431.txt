Orchestra Rehearsal (Italian: Prova d'orchestra) is a 1978 Italian satirical film directed by Federico Fellini. It follows an Italian orchestra as the members go on strike against the conductor. The film was shown out of competition at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival.The picture has been interpreted as a metaphor for Italian politics, with the orchestra quarreling instead of working together. Considered by some to be underrated, Orchestra Rehearsal was the last collaboration between composer Nino Rota and Fellini, due to Rota's death in 1979.
