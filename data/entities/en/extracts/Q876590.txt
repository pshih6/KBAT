Julius Leopold Korngold (December 24, 1860 â€“ September 25, 1945) was a noted music critic. He was regarded as the top critic in Vienna in the early twentieth century, when that city was viewed as the centre of classical music. He is most notable for championing the works of Gustav Mahler at a time when many did not think much of him. He was the father of composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold. He co-wrote the libretto of the opera Die tote Stadt with his son (under the collective pseudonym Paul Schott).
