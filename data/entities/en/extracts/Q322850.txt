William Bunch (December 21, 1902 â€“ December 21, 1941), known as Peetie Wheatstraw, was an American musician, an influential figure among 1930s blues singers.  The only known photograph of him shows him holding a National brand tricone resonator guitar, but he played the piano on most of his recordings.
