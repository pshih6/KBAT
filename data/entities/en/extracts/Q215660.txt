Lisa Tetzner (born in Zittau, Saxony on 10 November 1894; died on 2 July 1963 in Carona, Switzerland) was a German-born Swiss children's book writer known for her work with fairy-tales. In 1924 she married Kurt Held, a Jewish Communist. 
They fled to Switzerland in 1933 to escape the Nazis and in 1948 became Swiss citizens. Her book, Die schwarzen Br√ºder was published in 1941. The Swiss censored her work fearing it may antagonise the wartime German government. Later her "socialist fairy-tales" became popular in East Germany. One of her best-known works is The Children From No. 67 series written as a collaboration with her husband.  In the US Hans Sees The World was popular.  It was a translation from her original German, published in 1934 by Covici-Friede.
