Renato Salvatori (20 March 1933 â€“ 27 March 1988) was an Italian multi-purpose character actor.
He was born in Seravezza, Province of Lucca.
Salvatori acting career began as a teenager playing juvenile romantic roles. After working with a series of major directors, including Luchino Visconti, Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica, in the 1960s, he developed into one of Italy's strongest characters actors in grim and realistic drama.
He met French actress Annie Girardot on the set of the 1960 movie Rocco and His Brothers and married her on 6 January 1962. In sharp contrast to their off-camera relationship, in the movie Salvatori played a boxer-turned-thug who viciously rapes Annie, who played a prostitute. They had a daughter, Giulia; later they separated but never divorced.
Salvatori died in Rome of cirrhosis of the liver.
