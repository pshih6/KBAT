Tadeusz Dołęga-Mostowicz (pronounced [taˈdɛ.uʐ dɔˈwɛŋɡa mɔˈstɔvitʂ]; 10 August 1898 – 20 September 1939) was a Polish writer, journalist and author of over a dozen popular novels. One of his best known works, which in Poland became a byword for fortuitous careerism, was The Career of Nicodemus Dyzma (Polish: Kariera Nikodema Dyzmy, 1932). Literary historians believe that the book inspired the 1971 novel Being There by Jerzy Kosiński who sparked considerable controversy in the West.
