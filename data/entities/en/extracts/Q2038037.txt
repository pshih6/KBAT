Cyrus Pallonji Mistry (born 4 July 1968) is a businessman of Indian origin and Irish citizenship. He was the chairman of Tata Group, an Indian business conglomerate, from 2012 to 2016. He was the sixth chairman of the group, and only the second (after Nowroji Saklatwala) to not bear the surname Tata. In mid-2012, he was chosen by a selection panel to head the Tata Group and took charge in December the same year. In October 2016, the board of Tata Group's holding company, Tata Sons, voted to remove Mistry from the post of chairman after offering him an opportunity to resign voluntarily. Former chairman Ratan Tata then returned as interim chairman, and Natarajan Chandrasekaran was named as the new chair a few months later. However, in December 2019, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) declared the appointment of Chandrasekaran as executive chairman illegal, and restored Mistry. However, the Supreme Court stayed NCLAT's order on 10 January 2020. Mistry has filed a cross appeal in the court, seeking explanations for anomalies in the NCLAT.He owns an 18.4% stake in Tata Sons, through his company, Cyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd. In 2018, his net worth was approximately $10 billion. He was a member of the National Integration Council.
