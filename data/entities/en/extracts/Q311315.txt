Al-Kāẓimiyyah (Arabic: ٱلْكَاظِمِيَّة‎, pronounced [alˈkaːðˤɪmijːa]) or al-Kāẓimayn (ٱلْكَاظِمَيْن) is a northern neighbourhood of the city of Baghdad, Iraq. It is about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from the city's center, on the west bank of the Tigris. Al-Kāẓimiyyah is also the name of one of nine administrative districts in Baghdad. Being the place of Masjid al-Kāẓimayn (Arabic: مَسْجِد ٱلْكَاظِمَيْن‎, Mosque of the "Two who swallow their anger"), even before its inception into the urban area of Baghdad, it is regarded as a holy city by Twelver Shi'ites.
