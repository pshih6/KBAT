Liselotte Welskopf-Henrich (born Elisabeth Charlotte Henrich and identified in some sources simply as Elisabeth Charlotte Welskopf: 15 September 1901 - 16 June 1979) was a German novelist and historian of the classical period.  As a writer she concerned herself with two distinct cultures:  that of Ancient Greece and that of the "North American Indians" (as they would have been generally known when Welskopf-Henrich was working).   As an East German academic she was an influential authority on Ancient Greece.   Away from the university she wrote novels concerned with the North American Indians which became classics of East German children's literature.At the age of 10 she wrote a long letter to the Mexican president, urging him to proceed with greater humanity against Yaqui insurgents.
