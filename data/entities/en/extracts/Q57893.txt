Karl Wolff (13 May 1900 – 17 July 1984) was a German SS functionary and war criminal. He was Chief of Personal Staff Reichsführer-SS (Heinrich Himmler) and an SS liaison to Adolf Hitler until his replacement in 1943. He ended World War II as the Supreme SS and Police Leader in occupied Italy. Wolff evaded prosecution at the Nuremberg Trials, apparently as a result of his participation in  Operation Sunrise. In 1964, Wolff was convicted of war crimes in West Germany; he was released in 1969.
