Samuel Moore (born July 17, 1939), who performs and records as Ironing Board Sam, is an American electric blues keyboardist, singer and songwriter, who has released a small number of singles and albums. His musical career, despite several low points, has spanned over fifty years, and he released a new album in 2012. "I'll tell you one thing, it's the blues," he stated. "That's why I look like a blues man now."One commentator, describing Ironing Board Sam's 1996 album, Human Touch, noted that he "has a surprisingly smooth and effective croon and his piano playing, while subdued, is still remarkable."
