Jazzland Recordings is a Norwegian jazz and improvised music label based in Oslo, Norway, often associated with nu jazz.
It was founded in 1996 by pianist Bugge Wesseltoft to release his "New Conception of Jazz" and operate as a standalone label. There were three divisions of the Jazzland: "Jazzland", "Gr√ºner", and "Acoustic", but these were dropped.
