Charles III (Italian: Carlo III di Borbone, Duca di Parma e Piacenza; 14 January 1823 â€“ 27 March 1854) was Duke of Parma from 1849 to 1854.
He was the only son of Charles II Duke of Parma and was educated in Saxony and Vienna. He grew up as a restless young man and traveled extensively while he was hereditary Prince of Lucca. For a time he served in the Piedmontese army with the rank of Captain. In 1845, his father arranged his marriage with Princess Louise Marie of France, a wealthy heiress who gave him four children. In December 1847, at the death of Empress Marie Louise, his father Charles II became the reigning Duke of Parma, but abdicated on 24 March 1849. Charles III became the Duke of Parma, Piacenza and the Annexed States.
Charles III  owed his throne to the support of Austrian troops. He placed Parma under martial law, inflicted heavy penalties on the members of the late provisional government, closed the university, and instituted a regular policy of persecution.  His authoritarian policies made him unpopular. After reigning only five years, he was assassinated in March 1854.
