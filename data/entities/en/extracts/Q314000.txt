King Camp Gillette (January 5, 1855 â€“ July 9, 1932) was an American businessman. He invented a best selling version of the safety razor. Several models were in existence before Gillette's design. Gillette's innovation was the thin, inexpensive, disposable blade of stamped steel. Gillette is widely credited with inventing the so-called razor and blades business model, where razors are sold cheaply to increase the market for blades, but in fact the Gillette Safety Razor Company only adopted this model after its competitors did.
