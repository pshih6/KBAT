Jovan "Jova" Jovanović (Serbian Cyrillic: Јован "Јова" Јовановић, pronounced [jɔ̌v̞an jɔv̞ǎːnɔv̞it͡ɕ zmâj]; 24 November 1833 – 1 June 1904), also known as Јован Јовановић Змај (Jovan Jovanović Zmaj) or Змај (Zmaj), was a Serbian poet.
Jovanović worked as a physician; he wrote in many poetry genres, including love, lyric, patriotic, political, and youth, but he remains best known for his children's poetry. His nursery rhymes have entered the Serbian national consciousness and people sing them to their children without knowing who wrote them. Jovanović also translated the works of some of the great poets, such as Russians Lermontov and Pushkin, Germans Goethe and Heine, and the American Longfellow.
Jovanović's nickname Zmaj or Змај (dragon) derives from the 3 May 1848 assembly.
