Heading South (French: Vers le sud) is a 2005 French-Canadian drama film directed by Laurent Cantet and based on three short stories by Dany Laferri√®re. It depicts the experiences of three middle-aged white women in the late 1970s, traveling to Haiti for the purposes of sexual tourism with young men. Their adventures (as seen in their eyes) are juxtaposed with class issues and the deteriorating political climate of Haiti at the time. The women demonstrate different attitudes to the complex situation.
