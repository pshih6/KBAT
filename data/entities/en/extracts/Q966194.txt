Erwin Stricker (15 August 1950 â€“ 28 September 2010) was an Italian alpine skier who competed in the 1972 Winter Olympics and 1976 Winter Olympics.
Cavallo pazzo (in English Crazy horse), that was his nickname, was the first skier after Karl Schranz and Jean-Claude Killy to enter the first group of merit of all the specialties foreseen at his time (downhill, giant slalom and special slalom).
