Evan Almighty is a 2007 American fantasy disaster comedy film, and a stand-alone sequel and spin-off of Bruce Almighty (2003). The film was directed by Tom Shadyac, written by Steve Oedekerk, based on the characters created by Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe from the original film. It stars Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman reprising their roles as Evan Baxter and God, respectively, with newcomers Lauren Graham and John Goodman.
Production of the film began in January 2006. Several visual effect companies were used to provide CGI for the numerous animals and the climactic flood scene. The main plot is a modern-day retelling of Noah's Ark. By the time the film had completed production, it had become the most expensive comedy film ever (this record was later overtaken by Men in Black 3). In October 2007, the film was released on DVD and HD DVD.
The film opened on June 22, 2007, and made less than its budget of $175 million worldwide, while receiving generally negative reviews from critics. Evan Almighty was also a financial failure and was notable for allegations that the many animals used in the film were treated poorly, but Universal Pictures insisted the animals were treated humanely.
