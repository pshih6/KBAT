Joachim of Fiore, also known as Joachim of Flora and in Italian Gioacchino da Fiore (c. 1135 â€“ 30 March 1202), was an Italian theologian and the founder of the monastic order of San Giovanni in Fiore. According to theologian Bernard McGinn, "Joachim of Fiore is the most important apocalyptic thinker of the whole medieval period."Later followers, inspired by his works in eschatology and historicist theories, are called Joachimites.
