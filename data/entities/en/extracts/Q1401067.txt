Phaungkaza Maung Maung (Burmese: ဖောင်းကားစား မောင်မောင် [pʰàʊɰ̃ɡázá màʊɰ̃ màʊɰ̃]; 15 September 1763 – 11 February 1782) was the fifth king of the Konbaung Dynasty of Burma, whose reign lasted six days. Maung Maung, the eldest son of Naungdawgyi, the second king of the Konbaung Dynasty, was granted Phaungga in fief. On 5 February 1782, the 18-year-old Prince of Phaungka seized the throne while his cousin King Singu, was away on tour. His uncle Prince of Badon (later King Bodawpaya) quickly came to palace and deposed him on 11 February 1782. Maung Maung and his chief queen were drowned to death on the same day. He had four queens and no children.
