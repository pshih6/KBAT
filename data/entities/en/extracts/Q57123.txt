Alfred Josef Ferdinand Jodl (listen ) (10 May 1890 â€“ 16 October 1946) was a German Generaloberst who served as the Chief of the Operations Staff of the Armed Forces High Command (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht) throughout World War II.
After the war, Jodl was indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit crimes against peace; planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression; war crimes; and crimes against humanity at the Allied-organised Nuremberg trials. The principal charges against him related to his signature of the criminal Commando and Commissar Orders. Found guilty on all charges, he was sentenced to death and executed in Nuremberg in 1946.
