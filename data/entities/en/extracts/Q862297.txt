William Henry "Bill" Mauldin (; October 29, 1921 â€“ January 22, 2003) was an American editorial cartoonist who won two Pulitzer Prizes for his work.  He was most famous for his World War II cartoons depicting American soldiers, as represented by the archetypal characters Willie and Joe, two weary and bedraggled infantry troopers who stoically endure the difficulties and dangers of duty in the field. His cartoons were popular with soldiers throughout Europe, and with civilians in the United States as well.
