The 8th arrondissement of Paris (VIIIe arrondissement) is one of the 20 arrondissements of the capital city of France. In spoken French, this arrondissement is colloquially referred to as huitième (eighth/the eighth).
The arrondissement, called Élysée, is situated on the right bank of the River Seine and centred on the Champs-Élysées. The 8th is, together with the 1st, 9th, 16th, and 17th arrondissements, one of Paris's main business districts. According to the 1999 census, it was the place of employment of more people than any other single arrondissement of the capital. It is also the location of many places of interest, among them the Champs-Élysées, the Arc de Triomphe (partial), and the Place de la Concorde, as well as the Élysée Palace, the official residence of the President of France. Most French fashion luxury brands have their main store in 8th arrondissement, Avenue Montaigne or Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, both in the Champs-Elysees Avenue shopping district.
