Alexandra Hildebrandt (born Alexandra Weissmann on 27 February 1959 in Kiev) is a German artist, author, political activist and human rights activist. She is currently director of the Checkpoint Charlie Museum and the chair of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August Association. In 1995, she married the museum's other co-founder and former director Rainer Hildebrandt, and they remained married until his death in 2004. She is internationally noted for leading the construction of the Freedom Memorial, which was controversially demolished in 2005. The focus of Alexandra Hildebrandt's work is the preservation and advancement of the Checkpoint Charlie Museum, the rehabilitation of the victims of the GDR-Regime, and the clarification of more destinies of refugees who suffered death at the East-West border. Furthermore, she takes a stand for the worldwide non-violent struggle for human rights, which was a matter very close to her late husbands heart. In 2004 she endowed the international human rights award, the Dr. Rainer Hildebrandt Medal, which is given annually in recognition of extraordinary, non-violent commitment to human rights.From 2010 until 2013, Hildebrandt worked hard to secure the release of oligarch turned political activist, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Initially she started with an exhibition in her museum, the renown Checkpoint Charlie Museum, to raise awareness about the fate of Mr Khodorkovsky after Khodorkovskys lawyers and family asked her for help. Eventually, she involved former German Foreign Secretary, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, in her international campaign to free Khodorkovsky. In 2013 Khodorkovsky was released from prison after serving some ten years. In 2017, at the age of 58, she had her seventh child.
