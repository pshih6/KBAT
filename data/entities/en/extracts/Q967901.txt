Howard Devoto (born Howard Andrew Trafford  15 March 1952) is an English singer and songwriter, who began his career as the frontman for the punk rock band Buzzcocks, but then left to form Magazine, one of the first post-punk bands. After Magazine, he went solo and later formed indie band Luxuria.
His singing has been characterized as a "speak-sing voice that veered between amused croon and panicked yelp."
