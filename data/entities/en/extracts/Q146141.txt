Hans Christian Andersen is a 1952 Hollywood musical film directed by Charles Vidor, with lyrics and music by Frank Loesser. The story was by Myles Connolly, the screenplay was written by Moss Hart and Ben Hecht (uncredited), and Samuel Goldwyn Productions were the producers. It stars Danny Kaye.
The film was inspired by the life of 19th-century Danish poet and scholar Hans Christian Andersen, who wrote many world-famous fairy tales. But the story is romantic fiction, not a biography. The introduction describes it as "not the story of his life, but a fairy tale about this great spinner of fairy tales." Kaye, in the title role, portrays Andersen as a small-town cobbler with a childlike heart and a vivid imagination.
A large part of the narrative is told through song and ballet and includes many of the real Andersen's most famous stories, such as The Ugly Duckling, Thumbelina, The Emperor's New Clothes and The Little Mermaid. The film was an international success at the time of its release.
