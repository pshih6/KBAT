César Civita, born Cesare Civita (September 4, 1905 — April 9, 2005) was an American-Argentine publisher, who in 1936 became general manager of Arnoldo Mondadori Editore in Italy. Following passage of the Race Laws in 1938, he emigrated with his family to New York to escape the discriminatory restrictions since they were at risk for being Jewish.
He moved with his family again in 1941 to Buenos Aires, becoming Walt Disney's representative in Argentina and founding Editorial Abril that year. By the 1960s, his publishing house produced nine magazines.
His brother Victor Civita emigrated to Brazil, where he established Editora Abril in São Paulo in 1949. It developed into Grupo Abril, one of the largest publishing houses in the country.
