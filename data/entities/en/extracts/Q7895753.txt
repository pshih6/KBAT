The University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA or LS&A) is the liberal arts and sciences school of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Established in 1841 with seven students and two teachers, the college is currently the largest unit at U-M in terms of student enrollment. It is located on the university's Central Campus, which it shares with the Ross School of Business, the School of Information, the Law School, and other colleges. It is also home to the University of Michigan Honors Program. In March 2013 Helen Zell gave $50 million to LS&A, the largest gift in LS&A history, to support scholarships and stipends for Master's students in creative writing.
