Victor Saul Miller (born 3 March 1947 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American mathematician at the Center for Communications Research (CCR) of the Institute for Defense Analyses in Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.  He received his A.B. in mathematics from Columbia University in 1968, and his Ph.D. in mathematics from Harvard University in 1975.  He was an assistant professor in the Mathematics Department of the University of Massachusetts Boston from 1973 to 1978.  In 1978 he joined the IBM 801 project in the Computer Science Department of the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, and moved to the Mathematics Department in 1984.  Since 1993 he has been at CCR.
His main areas of interest are in Computational Number Theory, Combinatorics, Data Compression and Cryptography.  He is one of the co-inventors of Elliptic Curve Cryptography. He is also one of the co-inventors, with Mark Wegman, of the LZW data compression algorithm, and various extensions, one of which is used in the V.42bis international modem standard.  He received an IEEE Millennium medal for this invention. He is also the inventor of Miller's Algorithm which is of fundamental use in pairing-based cryptography.  He is also one of the co-inventors of the Lagarias-Miller-Odlyzko prime counting algorithm.Miller is the recipient of the RSA Award for Excellence in Mathematics which was given in the RSA Conference 2009, a Fellow of the IEEE, the International Association for Cryptologic Research and the Association for Computing Machinery.
