Hans Westmar (full title: Hans Westmar.  Einer von vielen. Ein deutsches Schicksal aus dem Jahre 1929 "Hans Westmar. One of many. A German Fate from the Year 1929") was the last of an unofficial trilogy of films produced by the Nazis shortly after coming to power in January 1933, celebrating their Kampfzeit â€“ the history of their period in opposition, struggling to gain power. 
The film is a partially fictionalized biography of the Nazi martyr Horst Wessel.
