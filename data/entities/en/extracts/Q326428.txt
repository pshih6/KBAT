Paradise, Hawaiian Style is a 1966 musical comedy film starring Elvis Presley. It was the third and final motion picture that Presley filmed in Hawaii. The film reached #40 on the Variety weekly box office chart, earning $2.5 million in theaters. In agreeing to do this film, Elvis' manager Colonel Tom Parker was hoping to replicate the success of Presley's 1961 film, Blue Hawaii. However, it was not a hit, and Presley's career continued its downward spiral.
