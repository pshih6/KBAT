Nahalat Yitzhak Cemetery (Hebrew: בית העלמין נחלת יצחק) is a Jewish municipal burial ground in Givatayim, Israel. Founded in 1932, it includes more than 30,000 graves, including those of Israeli political and cultural figures, and Rebbes of several Hasidic dynasties. The cemetery contains several tracts of military graves and mass graves of unidentified soldiers from the period of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. It also features memorials to Jewish communities destroyed in the Holocaust.
The cemetery is operated by the Chevra Kadisha of Greater Tel Aviv. The National Insurance Institute has declared it a "closed" cemetery, although burials occasionally take place here for people who pre-purchased their plots.
