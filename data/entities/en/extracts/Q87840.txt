Franz Wilhelm Ziegler (3 February 1803 â€“ 1 October 1876) was a lawyer, politician and writer.In 1848 he was a member of the Prussian National Assembly that emerged as part of the democratic revolutionary movement of the time, and in 1849 he was sentenced to a prison term because of his support for a motion of refusal to pay a supplementary tax to fund military expansion. As the Prussian state moved hesitantly towards a version of parliamentary democracy, Ziegler sat as a member of parliament.   He was an early member of the Progressive Party, but differed with it in 1866 over the issue of war with Austria.
