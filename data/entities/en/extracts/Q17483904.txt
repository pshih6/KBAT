Guy-Louis Vernansal (1648-1729) was a French painter. He studied under Charles Le Brun and produced tapestry designs for the Gobelins and Beauvais manufactories. He was admitted to the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture in 1687, though he spent much of his life in Italy, particularly Rome and Padua.
