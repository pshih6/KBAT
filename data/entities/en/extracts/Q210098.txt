Rapallo (US:  rə-PAH-loh, Italian: [raˈpallo], Ligurian: [ɾaˈpalˑu]) is a municipality in the Metropolitan City of Genoa, located in the Liguria region of northern Italy.
As of 2017 it counted 29,778 inhabitants. It lies on the Ligurian Sea coast, on the Tigullio Gulf, between Portofino and Chiavari, 25 kilometers east-south east of Genoa itself.
The climate is moderate. Many of the villas are built in the hills that rise immediately behind the city, protecting them from strong northern winds.
