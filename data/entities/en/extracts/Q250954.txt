Beloved is a 1998 American fantasy drama film directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, and Thandie Newton. Based on Toni Morrison's 1987 novel of the same name, the plot centers on a former slave after the American Civil War, her haunting by a poltergeist, and the visitation of her reincarnated daughter. 
Despite being a box office bomb, Beloved received an Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design for Colleen Atwood, and both Danny Glover and Kimberly Elise received praise for their performances.
