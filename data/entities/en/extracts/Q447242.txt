Mirzā Jahāngir Khān (≈1870, or 1875, Shiraz — June 23, 1908, Tehran) (Persian: میرزا جهانگیرخان‎), also known as Mirzā Jahāngir Khān Shirāzi (شيرازى ) and Jahāngir-Khān-e Sūr-e-Esrāfil (جهانگیرخان صوراسرافیل), was an Iranian writer and intellectual, and a revolutionary during the Iranian Constitutional Revolution (1905–1911). He is best known for his bold editorship of the progressive weekly newspaper Sur-e Esrāfil, of which he was also the founder. He was executed, at the age of 38, or 32, for his revolutionary zeal, following the successful coup d'état of Mohammad-Ali Shah Qajar in June 1908. His execution took place in Bāgh-e Shāh (باغشاه - The Garden of Shah) in Tehran, and was attended by Mohammad-Ali Shah himself. He shared this fate simultaneously with his fellow revolutionary Mirzā Nasro'llah Beheshti, better known as Malek al-Motakallemin. It has been reported that immediately before his execution he had said "Long live the constitutional government" (Zendeh bād Mashrouteh) and pointed to the ground and uttered the words "O Land, we are [being] killed for the sake of your preservation [/protection]" (Ey Khāk, mā barāye hefz-e to koshteh shodim).
