Graeme Murray Walker,  (born 10 October 1923) is a semi-retired English motorsport commentator and journalist. He provided television commentary of live Formula 1 coverage for the BBC between 1976 and 1996, and for ITV between 1997 and 2001.
During his 23-year run as full-time commentator, Walker became known for his animated enthusiasm, authoritative voice and comical blunders – dubbed "Murrayisms" by fans – during live races. His commentary voice has been likened to a "screech and resembles a 500cc engine being revved up". He is regarded by many as the greatest sports commentator of all time. He retired from full-time commentary after the 2001 United States Grand Prix, but has returned to broadcasting part-time in 2005 and has since made occasional appearances on the BBC, Channel 4 and Sky Sports F1.
