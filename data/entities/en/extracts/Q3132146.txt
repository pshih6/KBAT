Sakura Gakuin (Japanese: さくら学院, lit. 'Cherry Blossom Academy') is a Japanese idol girl group formed in 2010 by the Amuse talent agency. The group's membership falls within the age range of Japanese compulsory education, typically containing between 10 and 12 members at a time who fall between the ages of 10 and 15. With the theme of school life and extracurricular club activities, when the academic year ends at the end of March, the group releases an annual studio album, new members "transfer in" to the group, and others who finish compulsory education "graduate", or leave.
Members of the group also belong to one or more of its sub-units, which are modeled after school extracurricular clubs. Each club performs with its own theme and musical genre, and their music may be included in the main group's albums or released as a separate single.
