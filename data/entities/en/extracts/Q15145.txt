José Pablo Torcuato Batlle y Ordóñez (born 23 May 1856  in Montevideo, Uruguay – 20 October 1929) was a prominent Uruguayan politician, who served two terms as President of Uruguay for the Colorado Party. He was the son of a former president and was widely praised for his introduction of the political system Batllismo to South America, and his role in creating the modern Uruguay through his extensive welfare state reforms. 
In 1898, for a few weeks he served as interim president and later was elected to the presidency for two terms, from 1903 until 1907 and from 1911 to 1915. He remains one of the most popular Uruguayan presidents, in part due to his role as a social reformer. He is known for introducing  unemployment compensation, eight-hour workdays, and universal suffrage, as well as free High School education.
