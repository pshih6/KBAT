Leonid Borisovich Nevzlin (Russian: Леони́д Бори́сович Не́взлин; Hebrew: לאוניד בוריסוביץ' נבזלין‎, born 21 September 1959) is a Russian-born Israeli businessman, investor, and philanthropist.
Nevzlin occupied various high-ranking positions at Group Menatep and its subsidiary, the Yukos Oil Company. In 2003, the Russian state expropriated Yukos and began a campaign of persecution against its executives. Nevzlin was tried in absentia in Russia in March 2008, found guilty of several counts of conspiracy to murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 2014, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in favor of Nevzlin and other Yukos shareholders, calling the actions of the Russian state “a ruthless campaign to destroy Yukos and to expropriate its assets".
