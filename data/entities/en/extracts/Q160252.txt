Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton,  (3 December 1830 â€“ 25 January 1896), known as Sir Frederic Leighton between 1878 and 1896, was a British painter, draughtsman and sculptor. His works depicted historical, biblical, and classical subject matter in an academic style.  His paintings were enormously popular, and expensive, during his lifetime, but fell out of critical favour for many decades in the early 20th century.  
Leighton was the bearer of the shortest-lived peerage in history; after only one day his hereditary peerage became extinct upon his death.
