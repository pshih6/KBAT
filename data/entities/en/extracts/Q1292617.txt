The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada (French: Parti progressiste-conservateur du Canada; PC) was a federal political party in Canada.
In 2003, the party membership voted to dissolve the party and merge with the Canadian Alliance to form the modern-day Conservative Party of Canada.
One member of the Senate of Canada, Elaine McCoy, sat as an "Independent Progressive Conservative" until 2016. The conservative parties in most Canadian provinces still use the Progressive Conservative name. Some PC Party members formed the Progressive Canadian Party, which has attracted only marginal support.
