Natalia Morar (Romanian: Natalia Morari, Russian: Наталья Григорьевна Морарь; born 12 January 1984 in Kotovsk, Moldavian SSR) is a Moldovan investigative journalist for the Russian magazine New Times. She was a permanent resident of Russia until she was expelled in December 2007, presumably for exposing corruption in Russia. Born in Moldova, she moved to Russia in 2002 to study sociology at the Moscow State University, which she graduated in 2007. Morar applied for Russian citizenship, which she was supposed to get in April 2008, but the citizenship was denied citing national security reasons.
