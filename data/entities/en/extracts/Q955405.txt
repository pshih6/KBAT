Patrick Joseph Kennedy (January 14, 1858 â€“ May 18, 1929) was an American businessman and politician from Boston, Massachusetts. 
After cholera killed his father and brother, Kennedy was the only surviving male in his family. He started work at age fourteen as a stevedore in the docks and became a successful businessman, later owning three saloons and a whisky import house. Eventually, he had major interests in coal and banking as well. Kennedy was a major figure in the Democratic Party in Boston. Though he served in both the Massachusetts House of Representatives and the state Senate, he preferred to play a behind-the-scenes role as a party boss.
Kennedy and his wife, Mary, were the parents of four children, including future U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair and U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.. Kennedy's grandchildren include President of the United States John F. Kennedy, U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and longtime U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy.
