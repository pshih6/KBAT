1. April 2000 is a 1952 political satire film directed by Wolfgang Liebeneiner and starring Hilde Krahl, made during the Allied Occupation of Austria (1945â€“55). The script was reportedly commissioned at the request of the Austrian government, and is a political satire depicting a harmless, potentially congenial future Austria still subject to needless and stifling oversight by the four Allied powers, as established following the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II (as it was when the film was made). The film was entered into the 1953 Cannes Film Festival.
