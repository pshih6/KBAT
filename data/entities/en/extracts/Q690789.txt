LATAM Airlines Brasil, formerly TAM Airlines (Portuguese: TAM Linhas Aéreas), is the Brazilian brand of LATAM Airlines Group. The merger of TAM with LAN Airlines was completed on June 22, 2012. According to the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil (ANAC), between January and December 2018, LATAM had 31.9% of the domestic, and 68.5% of the international market share in terms of passenger-kilometers flown, making it the second largest domestic and largest international airline in Brazil.
Before the takeover, TAM was Brazil's and Latin America's largest airline. Its headquarters are in São Paulo, operating scheduled services to destinations within Brazil, as well as international flights to Europe and other parts of North and South America. Shares in the company were traded on the São Paulo Exchange (BM&F Bovespa) and New York Stock Exchange as "TAM". Prior to the merger with LAN, the company closed its capital, transferring its shares to LATAM Airlines Group. However, in August 2015, it was announced that the two airlines would fully rebrand as LATAM, with one livery to be applied on all aircraft by 2018. The airline withdrew from the Star Alliance, and joined Oneworld, effective 31 March 2014. The carrier announced, however, on 27 September 2019 that it intends to leave Oneworld "in due course and in accordance with formal contractual requirements," following a $1.9 billion investment - which represents a 20% stake - by Delta Air Lines.
