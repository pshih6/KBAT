Led Apple (Korean: 레드애플) was a three-member South Korean rock band formed by Starkim Entertainment in 2010 originally as LEDApple. The band's final lineup consisted of Seo Youngjun (Jun), Lee Kyumin (Kei) and Kim Hyoseok (AKi)
The part "Led" in LEDApple stood for "Logic Egoism Delete" and was promoted during their debut but they stopped referring to it since their CODA mini-album was released. Instead they replaced it with a practical explanation of "shining as brightly as LED whenever they perform" which was eventually referred to as a tribute to their role-model, Led Zeppelin. The word "Apple" in the band's name is supposed to represent their fresh image as idols and fresh music that they release. On August 16, 2015 it was announced that the band would be changing their name to LedT starting on September 1, 2015.The band made their debut on October 6, 2010 with their promotional single, "Dash" (Korean: 대쉬), a remake of Baek Ji-young's song of the same name. Since their debut, the band have released six singles and three mini-albums. The group disbanded March 6, 2016.
