Yenakiieve (Ukrainian: Єнáкієве, Yenakiieve; Russian: Ена́киево, Yenakiyevo), a city in the Donetsk Oblast (province) of eastern Ukraine, is incorporated as a city of oblast significance (a special status within the region equal to that of a raion (district)). The city stands on the Krynka River about 60 kilometres (37 mi) from the oblast's administrative center, Donetsk. Its population is approximately 79,348 (2017 est.).
Yenakiieve is an important regional centre of coal mining, metallurgy, chemical production and manufacturing. The city's outdated industry has caused accidents like that of a gas explosion which occurred in June 2008 at one of Yenakiieve's coal mines.
Yenakiieve was founded in 1898 when numerous workers' settlements around the Peter's Iron and Steel Works were united into a single settlement named after Fyodor Yenakiyev. Its first coal mines had dated from 1883. The settlement was incorporated as a city in 1925. By 1958, the city and factories had expanded significantly and overtook the out-lying villages of Simyukuo, Yevrah, and Tsiminyenny, all of which were resettled in their entirety when local livestock could not survive the expanding steel mills' runoff and pollution.
One of the oldest metallurgical factories of Ukraine—the Yenakiieve Iron and Steel Works—operates in Yenakiieve.
The city is known as the birthplace of the former President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych (in office 2010–2014).
