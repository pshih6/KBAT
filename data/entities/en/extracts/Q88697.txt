Aaron Isaac (Hebrew: אהרון יצחק‎; lived 1730–1817) was a Jewish seal engraver and merchant in haberdashery. He came from Pommery (Swedish Pomerania), a German-speaking area then part of the Swedish Empire, during the reign of Gustav III, and was persuaded to come to Sweden where there were no seal-engravers at the time. He did this on condition that he could bring with him at least ten Jews, in order to have a minyan (quorum) for prayer. His native language was Yiddish.
