Alexander Emric (or Emerick) Jones (born February 11, 1974) is an American radio show host and far-right conspiracy theorist. He hosts The Alex Jones Show from Austin, Texas, which the Genesis Communications Network syndicates across the United States and online. Jones' website, InfoWars, is derived from  conspiracy theories and fake news, as are websites NewsWars and PrisonPlanet.
Jones began his broadcasting career in the 1990s running a live public-access cable television program, later switching to radio. He has been at the center of many controversies: he promoted conspiracy theories about the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting. In other conspiracy theories, Jones has accused the US government of planning the Oklahoma City bombing, the September 11 attacks, and falsifying details regarding the 1969 Moon landing. He has claimed that several governments and big businesses have colluded to create a "New World Order" through "manufactured economic crises, sophisticated surveillance tech and—above all—inside-job terror attacks that fuel exploitable hysteria". He aggressively opposed gun control in a debate with Piers Morgan.Jones has described himself as a conservative, paleoconservative and libertarian, terms he uses interchangeably. Others describe him as conservative, right-wing, alt-right, and far-right. New York magazine has described Jones as "America's leading conspiracy theorist", and the Southern Poverty Law Center describes him as "the most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary America". Asked about such labels, Jones said he is "proud to be listed as a thought criminal against Big Brother".
