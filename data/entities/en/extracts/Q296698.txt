Costa-Gavras (short for Konstantinos Gavras; Greek: Κωνσταντίνος Γαβράς; born 12 February 1933) is a Greek-French film director and producer who lives and works in France. He is known for films with overt political themes, such as the political thrillers Z (1969, Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film) and Missing (1982), for which he won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Most of his movies have been made in French; however, six of them were made in the English language: Missing (1982), Hanna K. (1983), Betrayed (1988), Music Box (1989), Mad City (1997), and Amen. (2002). The majority of Gavras' films are produced by the director himself, through his production company K.G. Productions.
