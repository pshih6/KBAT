Antioch College is a private liberal arts college in Yellow Springs, Ohio.  Founded in 1850 by the Christian Connection, the college began operating in 1852 as a non-sectarian institution; politician and education reformer Horace Mann became its first president. It was the founding, constituent college of Antioch University System, which Antioch College remained a part of from 1978 until 2008 when it closed. Thereafter, a group of alumni formed a new Ohio corporation, Antioch College Continuation Corporation, and bought from the University both the physical campus and a license to use the name "Antioch College".  The college remained closed for three years before reopening in 2011 as an independent institution.
Antioch is one of only a few liberal-arts institutions in the United States featuring a cooperative education work program mandatory for all students. Democracy and shared governance, especially as a means to activism and social justice, are at the heart of the college. Since 1921 Antioch's educational approach has blended practical work experience with classroom learning, and participatory community governance. Students receive narrative evaluations and academic letter grades.
Antioch College is a member of the Great Lakes Colleges Association, the Global Liberal Arts Alliance, and the Southwestern Ohio Council for Higher Education. The college has produced two Nobel Prize winners. Jos√© Ramos-Horta, the 1996 laureate for Peace, obtained his Master of Arts at Antioch in 1984. Mario Capecchi, the 2007 laureate for Medicine, earned the Bachelor of Science from Antioch in 1961.
