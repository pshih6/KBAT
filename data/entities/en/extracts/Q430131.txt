Hercules and the Treasure of the Incas (Italian: Sansone e il tesoro degli Incas) is a 1964 film written and directed by Piero Pierotti  and starring  Alan Steel. Originally conceived as a peplum film, given the contemporary success of A Fistful of Dollars, it was turned into a western film during the shootings, resulting in a bizarre crossover between the two genres.
