Baron Anton von Doblhoff-Dier (German: Anton Freiherr von Doblhoff-Dier) (10 November 1800 â€“ 16 April 1872) was an Austrian statesman.
Born in Gorizia, he studied law at the University of Vienna and at first entered into civil service. In 1836 he retired to cultivate the manor estate of his uncle at Weikersdorf Castle in Baden, where he excelled in agronomic studies. In the course of the Revolutions of March 1848 he became a liberal member of the Reichstag assembly and trade minister in the cabinet of Franz von Pillersdorf, and, after Pillersdorf's demission in July, acting minister-president and minister of the interior.
Doblhoff-Dier himself resigned from all offices in the violent Vienna Uprising of October 1848. In the next year he was appointed ambassador at The Hague, a post he held until 1858. In 1861 he became a member of the newly established Reichsrat, from 1867 onwards of the Herrenhaus.
