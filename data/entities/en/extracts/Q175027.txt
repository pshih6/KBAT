12 Rounds is a British rock band formed by Atticus Ross and singer Claudia Sarne, who are married. After the release of their first album, Jitter Juice, they toured with the Sneaker Pimps. 12 Rounds played the Reading Festival in 1996. Their song "Something's Burning" was featured on the soundtrack to the 1997 film All Over Me, and "Just Another Day," their collaboration with Pale 3, was featured on the soundtrack to the 2000 film The Princess and the Warrior. The group released a few projects under various record labels before releasing My Big Hero under Trent Reznor's Nothing Records.
