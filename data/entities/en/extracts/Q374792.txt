Sven Erik Alf Sjöberg (21 June 1903 – 17 April 1980) was a Swedish theatre and film director. He won the Grand Prix du Festival at the Cannes Film Festival twice: in 1946 for Torment (Swedish: Hets) (part of an eleven-way tie), and in 1951 for his film Miss Julie (Swedish: Fröken Julie) (an adaptation of August Strindberg's play which tied with Vittorio De Sica's Miracle in Milan).
Despite his success with films Torment (1944) and Miss Julie (1951), Sjöberg was foremost a stage director; perhaps the greatest at Dramaten (alongside first Olof Molander and later Ingmar Bergman). He was a First Director of Sweden's Royal Dramatic Theatre in the years 1930–1980, where he staged many remarkable and historic productions. Sjöberg was also a pioneer director of drama for early Swedish TV (his 1955 TV production of Hamlet is a national milestone). At the 3rd Guldbagge Awards Sjöberg won the award for Best Director for the film Ön.Sjöberg died in a car accident on his way to rehearsal at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm.
