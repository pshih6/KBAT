Charles Gascoigne (1738â€“1806) was a British industrialist at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.  He was a partner and manager of the Carron Company ironworks in its early years, but left in 1786, before the company's success became obvious, to reorganise the production of iron and cannon in Russia.  He remained in Russia for 20 years, until his death.
