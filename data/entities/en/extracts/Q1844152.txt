Dominick Martin, better known by his stage name Calibre, is a Northern Irish drum and bass music producer and DJ from Belfast. He started producing at a young age. He is a classically trained musician, playing a variety of musical instruments. Martin started producing Drum and Bass in 1995 and his first signed release was credited under the now defunct Quadrophonic record label.He soon came to the attention of drum and bass DJ Fabio, who signed Calibre to his record label, Creative Source.
While studying Fine Arts at the University of Ulster in Belfast, he became interested in the music of John Cage whose work was influential in titling Martin’s first album release Musique Concrète in 2001. Since his initial releases in 2001, Martin has been known for his consistent signature style and sound.
Short Circuits Magazine refers to him as "one of the quietest people in drum and bass". Although one of the scene's most prolific producers, he shares tracks with only a small circle of friends and many of his works remain unreleased. Beginning in 2007, the 'Shelflife' series of albums were created as a way of sharing previously unreleased productions with his fans.
Over 20 years of music production, he has self-published over 60 singles and 10 albums. Also, according to UKF as of 2014, none of his original productions have ever been officially remixed.
