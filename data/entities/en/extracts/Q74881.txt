Dalian is a major sub-provincial port city in Liaoning province, China, and is Liaoning's second largest city (after the provincial capital Shenyang) and the fourth most populous city of Northeast China.  Located on the southern tip of Liaodong peninsula, it is the southernmost city in both Liaoning and the entire Northeast.  Dalian borders the prefectural cities of Yingkou and Anshan to the north and Dandong to the northeast, and also shares maritime boundaries with Qinhuangdao and Huludao across the Liaodong Bay to west and northwest, Yantai and Weihai on the Shandong peninsula across the Bohai Strait to the south, and North Korea across the Korea Bay to the east.
Today a financial, shipping and logistics centre for Northeast Asia, Dalian has a significant history of being used by foreign powers for its ports. Dalian was previously known as both "Dalniy" (Russian: Дальний; Dal'nii) and "Dairen" (Japanese: 大連). However, the city used to be better known as "Port Arthur" (Russian: Порт-Артур; Port-Artur) and "Ryojun" (Japanese: 旅順) from the original Port Arthur, now the city's Lüshunkou district.
In 2016, Dalian ranked 48th in the Global Financial Centres Index, the other Chinese cities on the list being Hong Kong, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing and Qingdao. In 2012, Dalian ranked 82nd in the Global City Competitiveness Index. In 2006, Dalian was named China's most livable city by China Daily.
