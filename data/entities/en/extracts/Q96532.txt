He studied theology and philology at the University of Wittenberg, where he was student of Christian Lobeck (1781–1860). In 1811 he became conrector at the Lyceum at Wittenberg, where two years later he was appointed rector. In 1820 he relocated to the Gymnasium at Erfurt, and in 1824 returned to his former position at the Wittenberg Lyceum.
