Abu al-Qasim Abbas ibn Firnas ibn Wirdas al-Takurini (809–887 A.D.), also known as Abbas ibn Firnas (Arabic: عباس بن فرناس‎), was an Andalusian polymath: an inventor, physician, chemist, engineer, Andalusian musician, and Arabic-language poet. He was born in Ronda in the Takurunna province from Berber parents and lived in Córdoba. A pioneer of aircraft and aviation, Ibn Firnas built the first human carrying glider and is reputed to have attempted two successful flights.Ibn Firnas made various contributions in the field of astronomy and engineering. He constructed a device which indicated the motion of the planets and stars in the Universe. In addition, Ibn Firnas came up with a procedure of manufacturing colourless glass and made magnifying lenses for reading, which was called reading stones. His method of cutting rock crystal give huge opportunities for Spanish mines to cut quartz, instead of exporting stones to places such as Egypt to be cut. He also designed the al-Maqata, a water clock.A long statue of Ibn Firnas was built near the Baghdad Airport. The crater Ibn Firnas on the Moon is named in his honor, and one of the bridges over the Guadalquivir river in Córdoba was also named after him.
