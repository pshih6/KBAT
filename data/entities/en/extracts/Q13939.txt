Terrassa (Catalan pronunciation: [təˈrasə], Spanish: Tarrasa) is a city in the east central region of Catalonia, in the province of Barcelona, comarca of Vallès Occidental, of which it is the cocapital along with Sabadell. The name "Terrassa" may well be a contraction/corruption of late Latin: 'terra ix ipsa' -> proto-aragonese 'terra-iš-sa' (Eng: 'that avian/'cool' place') potentially conflated with 'terra-ès-sà' "safe-place/clean-place".
It is the site of Roman Egara, a former Visigothic bishopric, which became a Latin Catholic titular see.
The city is located in the Catalan Prelitoral depression (Depressió Prelitoral), at the feet of the Prelitoral mountain range (Natural reserve of Sant Llorenç del Munt) and the average altitude of the city is 277 meters above sea level. It is 20 and 18 kilometres from Barcelona and Montserrat respectively.
Terrassa is the third largest city in Catalonia, after Barcelona and L’Hospitalet.
