Oliver Ames (February 4, 1831 – October 22, 1895) was an American businessman, investor, politician, and philanthropist from Massachusetts.  He was the son of Oakes Ames (1804–1873), a railroad tycoon behind the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) who was notably censured in the Credit Mobilier scandal for actions taken while a United States Congressman.  Ames was executor of his father's estate, and took over many of his business interests.  A Republican, he served as the 35th Governor of Massachusetts (1887–1890).  He was a major philanthropist, especially in his hometown of Easton, which is graced by a number of architecturally significant works by H.H. Richardson as a result of his influence.
