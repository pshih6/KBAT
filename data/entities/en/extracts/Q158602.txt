Four Stars (also known as ****) is a 1967 avant-garde film by Andy Warhol, actually consisting of 25 hours of film. In typical Warhol fashion of the period, each reel of the film is 35 minutes long, or 1200 ft. in length, and is shot in sync-sound.
The film's title is a pun on the rating system used by critics to rank films, with "four stars" being the highest rating.
