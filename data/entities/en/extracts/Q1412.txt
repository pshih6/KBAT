Finnish, whose endonym is suomi ([ˈsuo̯mi] (listen) or suomen kieli [ˈsuo̯meŋ ˈkie̯li]) is a Uralic language of the Finnic branch spoken by the majority of the population in Finland and by ethnic Finns outside Finland. Finnish, along with Swedish, is an official language of Finland; Finnish is also an official minority language in Sweden. In Sweden, both Standard Finnish and Meänkieli, its own language or a dialect of Finnish, are spoken. The Kven language, a dialect of Finnish or even a distinct language, is spoken in Northern Norway by a minority group of Finnish descent. The status of Kven and Meänkieli is debated.
Finnish is a member of the Finnic language family and is typologically between fusional and agglutinative languages. It modifies and inflects nouns, adjectives, pronouns, numerals and verbs, depending on their roles in the sentence. Sentences are normally formed following the subject–verb–object syntax, although the extensive use of inflection allows them to be ordered otherwise. Words are written using a Latin-script alphabet derived from the Swedish alphabet, and are meant to be spelled exactly as they are pronounced, with each letter representing one phoneme. Vowel length and geminated consonants are distinguished, and its phonology includes a range of diphthongs, although vowel harmony limits which diphthongs are possible.
