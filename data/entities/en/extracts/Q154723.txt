Viktor Emil Frankl (26 March 1905 – 2 September 1997)
was an Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist as well as a Holocaust survivor, surviving Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, Kaufering and Türkheim. Frankl was the founder of the logotherapy method (based on the will to meaning principle) and is most notable for his best-selling book Man's Search for Meaning. The book is an account within the concentration camp hierarchy, where in various camps he practiced, 'concluded' and several times quotes, the validity of means for a Nietzschean survival. Frankl was, for a time, a minor figure in existential therapy and influenced humanistic psychology.
He has been the subject of some criticism from notable holocaust analysts 
who question the levels of Nazi collaboration by Frankl, the inherence in the ideology of logotherapy and its origins itself. A disparate group of others also raise doubts in regard to acts which Frankl willingly pursued in the time before his internment; during that time, as a member of the austro-fascist Fatherland Front, without any medical precedence or training as a surgeon, Frankl - under the oversight of the Nazi administration - insisted on performing experimental Lobotomies on Jews who had resisted arrest, with an overdose of sedatives, and were declared dead by other doctors of the Reich,
which psychiatrists and biographers alike suggest comprises a link to Nazi human experimentation. These and other incidents, hinted at in Frankl's own autobiographical account, such as receiving Nazi premium coupons, then promotion into the senior prison warden position, the Kapo; that, as well as further events after the war, such as the possible cleansing of Frankl's Gestapo file, continue to be looked at by researchers.
