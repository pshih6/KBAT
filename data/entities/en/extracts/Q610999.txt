The Dragon School is one school on two sites in Oxford, England. The Prep School (children aged 8–13) and Dragon Pre-Prep (ages 4–7) are both co-educational schools. The Dragon Prep School was founded in 1877 as the Oxford Preparatory School. It takes day pupils and boarders.
Originally established for boys, the Dragon School also accepted a small number of day girls with a close connection to the school, first admitting girls as boarders in 1994. The Dragon School is a feeder school to many independent schools, including Eton College, Shrewsbury School, Cheltenham Ladies' College, Harrow School, Radley College, Rugby School, Marlborough College, Canford School, St Edward's School, Oxford and Abingdon School.
The Dragon educates children from aged 4 to 13 in two sites in North Oxford: Bardwell Road and Richards Lane. Boarding starts at 8 and there are 10 boarding houses, including one weekly-boarding house.
