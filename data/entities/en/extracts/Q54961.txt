Harrow () is a large suburban town in Greater London, England. It serves as the principal settlement of the London Borough of Harrow, lying about 10.5 miles (16.9 km) northwest of Charing Cross, and 5.4 miles (8.7 km) south of Watford. The entire town, including its localities Harrow on the Hill, Harrow Weald, Headstone, North Harrow, Kenton, Rayners Lane, South Harrow, Wealdstone and West Harrow, had a population of 149,246 as of the 2011 census, whereas the wider borough had a population of 250,149.
Historically in Middlesex, Harrow was a municipal borough before it became a part of Greater London in 1965. The modern town of Harrow is what was historically called Greenhill, a former hamlet at the foot of the 408 feet (124 m) Harrow Hill settlement. With the arrival of the Metropolitan Railway in the 19th century, the centre of Harrow moved to Greenhill and it grew as the unofficial "capital" of the Metro-land suburbia. The historic centre of Harrow, often distinguished as Harrow on the Hill, is a conservation area with listed buildings of Georgian architecture and home to the famous Harrow School. The modern-day town of Harrow is an established commercial centre of outer North West London.
