Everton Football Club () is an English professional football club based in Liverpool that competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. The club has competed in the top division for a record 116 seasons and has missed the top division only four times (1930–31, 1951–52, 1952–53, and 1953–54) since the creation of the Football League, of which it is a founding member. The club has won nine League Championships, five FA Cups, and one UEFA Cup Winners Cup.
Formed in 1878, Everton won its first League Championship during the 1890–91 season. After winning four more League Championships and two FA Cups, the club experienced a post-World War II lull until a revival in the 1960s. A period of sustained success came in the mid-1980s, when Everton won a further two League Championships, one FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners' Cup. The club's most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup.
The club's supporters are colloquially known as "Evertonians" or "Blues". Everton has a rivalry with Liverpool, and the two sides contest the Merseyside derby. The club has been based at Goodison Park in Walton since 1892, after moving from Anfield following a disagreement over its rent. The club's home colours are royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks.
