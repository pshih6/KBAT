The Lycée Pasteur (French: Lycée Pasteur de Neuilly-sur-Seine) is a French state-run secondary school in Neuilly-sur-Seine, on the outskirts of Paris. It accepts students from collège (the first four years of secondary education in France) through to classes préparatoires (classes to prepare students for entrance to the elite Grandes écoles). Built in the grounds of the former chateau de Neuilly, the lycée is named in honour of Louis Pasteur. It was originally planned to open in October 1914 but with the advent of the First World War the building was instead used as a military hospital by American Field Services and not inaugurated until October 1923. 
It was used as the location for the film, Neuilly sa mère !
