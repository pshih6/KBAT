Andy Linden (April 5, 1922 â€“ February 10, 1987) was an American racecar driver from Brownsville, Pennsylvania. Having served as a US Marine, he raced with great success until a 1957 crash caused a piece of metal to break his helmet, causing career ending brain damage. He is also technically a former Formula One World Championship driver, as the Indianapolis 500 was part of the FIA World Championship from 1950 through 1960, meaning that drivers competing at Indy during those years were credited with World Championship points and participation. Linden thus participated in 7 World Championship races, accumulating a total of 5 championship points.
