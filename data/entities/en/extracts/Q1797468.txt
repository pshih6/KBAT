Samuel Klein (15 November 1923 â€“ 20 November 2014) was a Polish-Brazilian business magnate and philanthropist who founded the Casas Bahia chain of department stores in Brazil, building them into the top retailer in the country. This along with his tendency to use massive warehouses for his goods, including the largest single warehouse in South America, led him to be known in the 1990s as the "Sam Walton of Brazil".Through Casas Bahia, Klein's family became one of the wealthiest families in Brazil. In 2013, Forbes ranked him 78th richest person in Brazil with a personal net worth of $835 million, while his son, Michael, was ranked 87th with $723 million.
