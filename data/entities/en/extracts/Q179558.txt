Alexandra Mikhailovna Kollontai (Russian: Алекса́ндра Миха́йловна Коллонта́й — née Domontovich, Домонто́вич; 31 March [O.S. 19 March] 1872 – 9 March 1952) was a Marxist revolutionary, first as a member of the Mensheviks, then from 1915 on as a Bolshevik (later  Communist). Serving as the People's Commissar for Welfare in the Bolshevik government in 1917–1918, she became the first woman in history to become an official  member of a governing cabinet.
In 1922 Kollontai was appointed as a diplomatic counsellor to the Soviet legation in Norway, and soon received promotion to head the legation, one of the first women to hold such a position.
