Antoine de Chézy (1 September 1718, in Châlons-en-Champagne – 5 October 1798, Paris) was a French hydraulics engineer. He is known for the Chézy formula, which concerned the velocity of pipe flow, and in modified form he used it for open channel flow as well. He died in 1798 after being director of the École nationale des ponts et chaussées for less than a year. His son was the orientalist Antoine-Léonard de Chézy.
