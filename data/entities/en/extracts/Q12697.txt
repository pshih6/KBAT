The canton of Schaffhausen, also canton of Schaffouse (German: Schaffhausen ) is the northernmost canton of Switzerland. The principal city and capital of the canton is Schaffhausen. The canton's territory is divided into three non-contiguous segments, where German territory reaches the Rhine. The large central part, which includes the capital, in turn separates the German exclave of BÃ¼singen am Hochrhein from the rest of Germany.
