William Henry Smith, FRS (24 June 1825 â€“ 6 October 1891) was an English bookseller and newsagent of the family firm W H Smith, who expanded the firm and introduced the practice of selling books and newspapers at railway stations.  He was elected a Member of Parliament in 1868 and rose to the position of First Lord of the Admiralty less than ten years thereafter.  Because of his lack of naval experience, he was perceived as a model for the character Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S. Pinafore.  In the mid-1880s, he was twice Secretary of State for War, and later First Lord of the Treasury and Leader of the House of Commons, among other posts.
