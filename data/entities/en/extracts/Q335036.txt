Alter Bridge is an American rock band from Orlando, Florida. The band was formed in 2004 by vocalist/rhythm guitarist Myles Kennedy, lead guitarist Mark Tremonti, bassist Brian Marshall and drummer Scott Phillips. After their former band Creed became inactive in 2003, Tremonti and Phillips formed a new band with former bandmate Marshall and new member Kennedy; Alter Bridge was formally unveiled in January 2004, months before Creed's official breakup in June.
After signing with Wind-up Records, Alter Bridge released its debut album One Day Remains in August 2004, much of which was written by Tremonti the previous year. The album reached No. 5 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and, despite mixed reviews, was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in November 2004. This was followed in October 2007 by the more positively reviewed Blackbird, which marked the beginning of a long partnership between the band and producer Michael Baskette. The album reached No. 13 in the U.S. and was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry.
Following continued activities with the members' other bands and side projects, Alter Bridge released AB III in October 2010, which achieved critical acclaim and commercial success on Roadrunner Records, with the album's lead single "Isolation" topping the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. Alter Bridge released Fortress to further acclaim in September 2013, as the band's members continued splitting their time between various projects. The Last Hero followed on Napalm Records in October 2016, becoming the band's first album since its debut to reach the top ten of the Billboard 200, and its first to reach the top five of the UK Albums Chart. Alter Bridge's sixth studio album, Walk the Sky, was released in October 2019.
