Runaway Brain is a 1995 American one-reel animated cartoon produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation. Featuring Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, the short centers on Mickey attempting to earn money to pay for an anniversary gift for Minnie. He applies as a lab assistant for Dr. Frankenollie but finds he is looking for a donor to switch brains with the monster he created. Featuring animation by animator Andreas Deja, it was first released in 1995 attached to North American theatrical showings of A Kid in King Arthur's Court, in 1996 attached to international theatrical showings of A Goofy Movie and in 1999 attached to Australian theatrical showings of Toy Story 2. It would be the final original Mickey Mouse theatrical animated short until Get a Horse! in 2013.
Although receiving a controversial reception among audiences, the short was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 68th Academy Awards, losing to the Wallace and Gromit short A Close Shave. Later references to the cartoon have been made in Disney related media such as the video game Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance.
