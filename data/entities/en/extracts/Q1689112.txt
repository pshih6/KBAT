James Michael Hiscott (born 4 December 1948) is a Canadian composer, radio producer, and accordionist. An associate of the Canadian Music Centre and a member of the Canadian League of Composers, his compositions are characterized by their strong rhythmic base, standard harmonic language, and merger of world music with contemporary sounds and instrumentation. He has received commissions from the Great Lakes Brass Quintet, the Manitoba Puppet Theatre, Metis Arts of Manitoba, and Music Inter Alia. His 1973 work Planes was premiered by the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra in 1986 under conductor by Kazuhiro Koizumi.
