Rottweil (German: [ˈʁɔtvaɪl] (listen)) is a town in southwest Germany in the state of Baden-Württemberg. Rottweil was a Free Imperial City for nearly 600 years.
Located between the Black Forest and the Swabian Alps, Rottweil has almost 139,500 inhabitants as of 2019. The old town is famous for its medieval center and for its traditional carnival (called "Fasnet" in the local Swabian dialect). It is the oldest town in Baden-Württemberg, and its appearance has changed very little since the 16th century.
