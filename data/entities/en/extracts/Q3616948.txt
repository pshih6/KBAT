Angelo Dalle Molle (4 November 1908 â€“ 2001) was an Italian businessman and Utopian philanthropist. In 1952 he invented and patented Cynar, a bitter aperitivo based on artichoke leaves, which became famous partly due to advertisements with Ernesto Calindri and the slogan "contro il logorio della vita moderna", "against the stress of modern life".
