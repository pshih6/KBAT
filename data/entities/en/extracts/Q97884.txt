Ella Trebe (born Ella Beyer: 6 September 1902 - 11 August 1943) was a German factory worker who became an anti-government resistance activist after 1933.   She was charged with high treason but was then taken to Sachsenhausen concentration camp where she was shot dead, so that her case never came to trial.
