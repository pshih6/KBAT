Michael Wieck (born 19 July 1928) is a German violinist and author. Wieck's memoir, Zeugnis vom Untergang Königsbergs ("Witness to the fall of Königsberg"), was published in 1989. In it he relates his and his partly Jewish family's sufferings under the Nazis and, after the German defeat, under the Soviets. This moving story was translated into English in 2003 under the title A Childhood Under Hitler and Stalin: Memoirs of a "Certified Jew,", and in 2004 into Russian as Закат Кёнигсберга ("Sunset of Königsberg"). A revised Russian edition was published in 2015.
