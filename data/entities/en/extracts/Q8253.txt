Fiction generally is a narrative form, in any medium, consisting of people, events, or places that are imaginaryâ€”in other words, not based strictly on history or fact. It also commonly refers, more narrowly, to written narratives in prose and often specifically novels. In film, it generally corresponds to narrative film in opposition to documentary.
