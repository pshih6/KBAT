Gassin (French pronunciation: ​[ɡasɛ̃]) is a commune in the Var department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in southeastern France.
It is located very near to the holiday destination of Saint-Tropez. Perched high up on a rock, it is less than 4 km (2.5 mi) from the sea. Many Tropezian tourists attracted by a more affordable life prefer to stay in Gassin and enjoy the same kind of "Cote d'Azur" life.It lies 2 kilometres from route D559 which links Hyères (41 km) and Sainte-Maxime (12 km).
