Warendorf is a town in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, and capital of Warendorf District.
The town is best known today for its well-preserved medieval town centre, for horse-riding, and the opportunities it provides for cycling. Bicycles are such a common means of transport in the area that many cycle paths have been built, even alongside main roads outside the town.
