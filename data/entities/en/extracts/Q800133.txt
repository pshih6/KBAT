I Set My Friends on Fire (often abbreviated as ISMFOF) is an experimental rock group from Miami, Florida. The band was formed in 2007 by Matt Mehana and former member Nabil Moo. The group signed with Epitaph Records before releasing their debut album, You Can't Spell Slaughter Without Laughter, in 2008. Their second album, Astral Rejection, was originally supposed to be released on June 22, 2010, but the original recording was shelved by Epitaph, causing Nabil to leave and Matt and Chris having to re-write and re-record the record. It was then released on June 21, 2011. Shortly after, Chris Lent also left the band. Their third album, Caterpillar Sex, was announced in 2013 with a still TBA release date, though a number of demos and singles have been released. The band has also announced an untitled fourth album in 2016 with no release date confirmed. The group is known for their experimental style which fuses many electronic and aggressive rock genres together.
