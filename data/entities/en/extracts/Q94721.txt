Marisa Mell  (born Marlies Theres Moitzi; 24 February 1939 â€“ 16 May 1992) was an Austrian actress. Appearing in films across Europe in the sixties, she suffered a setback in the failure of an American musical. She settled in Italy where her high profile love life and long association with Pier Luigi Torri, a playboy later to become one of the most wanted fugitives in the world, made her familiar to readers of tabloid press stories about the European jet set and elite Rome nightclubs. Mell was typecast as a resilient femme fatale. In reality, she was a vulnerable figure who suffered from bad luck and ill-judged personal choices. In the eighties, she was forced to relocate back to Austria where she subsisted in straitened circumstances. Her best regarded film is the critically re-assessed Danger: Diabolik.
