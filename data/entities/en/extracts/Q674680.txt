It is well known by climbers and has a Via ferrata on the southern, Swiss face, in Graubünden. There are a total of  six known caves into the limestone mountain, with lengths between 800 and 3000 or more yards, with all entrances on the Eastern side, in Switzerland.The eastern side has a mountain path of grade T4,  allowing non-climbers to reach the 2817 metre summit.  This is part of a multi day walking route along the entire length of the Rätikon chain on the sunnier side, called "Prättigauer Höhenweg".
