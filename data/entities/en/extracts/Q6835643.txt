There are three research institutions associated with the school, namely The Lucy Lloyd Archive, Research and Exhibition Centre (LLAREC), the Centre for Curating the Archive (CCA) and the Katrine Harries Print Cabinet, which has been instrumental in promoting printmaking as well as conserving and exhibiting prints in the collection. 
The major graduate degree offered at the School is the Master of Fine Art where students work in both new and traditional fine art disciplines.
