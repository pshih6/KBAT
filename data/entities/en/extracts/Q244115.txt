55 Days at Peking is a 1963 American epic historical war film dramatizing siege of the foreign legations' compounds in Peking (now known as Beijing) during the Boxer Rebellion, which took place in China from 1898 to 1900. It is based on the book by Noel Gerson and produced by Samuel Bronston for Allied Artists, with a screenplay by Philip Yordan, Bernard Gordon, Robert Hamer, and Ben Barzman.
The film was directed primarily by Nicholas Ray, though Guy Green and Andrew Marton took over in the latter stages of filming after Ray fell ill. Both are uncredited. It stars Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner, and David Niven, with supporting roles by Flora Robson, John Ireland, Leo Genn, Robert Helpmann. Harry Andrews, and Kurt Kasznar. It also contains the first known screen appearance of future martial arts film star Yuen Siu Tien. Japanese film director Juzo Itami, credited in the film as "Ichizo Itami", appears as Col. Goro Shiba.
55 Days at Peking was released by Allied Artists on May 29, 1963 and received mixed reviews, mainly for its historical inaccuracies. However, the film was praised for its acting, direction, music, action sequences, and production design. In addition to its critical failure, the film grossed $10 million at the box office against a budget of only $9 million. Despite its financial failure, the film was nominated for two Academy Awards. It was director Ray's last film until Lightning Over Water (1980).
Ray said the film "epitomized the worst of Hollywood, and it was done by an independent producer who managed to deceive, steal, cheat . . . and bring all the worst aspects of Hollywood into a film being-shot in Spain. Itâ€™s a very painful film for me to talk about."
