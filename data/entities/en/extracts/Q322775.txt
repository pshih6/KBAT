The Académie de Stanislas is a learned society founded in Nancy, France on 28 December 1750 by the King of Poland, Duke of Lorraine and Bar, Stanisław Leszczyński, under the name Société Royale des Sciences et Belles-Lettres de Nancy.
It was established in the old Jesuit College, the building which founded the Nancy-Université until its temporary suppression by the Jacobin Convention in 1793, and which has now become the Municipal Library of Nancy.
