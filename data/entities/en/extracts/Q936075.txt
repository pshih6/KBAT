Samuel Brannan (March 2, 1819 â€“ May 5, 1889) was an American settler, businessman, journalist, and prominent Mormon who founded the  California Star, the first newspaper in San Francisco, California.  He is considered the first to publicize the California Gold Rush and was its first millionaire. He used the profits from his stores to buy large tracts of real estate. He helped form the first vigilance committee in San Francisco and was disfellowshiped from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) because of his actions within the vigilance committee. Brannan's wife divorced him and he was forced to liquidate much of his real estate to pay her one-half of their assets. He died poor and in relative obscurity.
