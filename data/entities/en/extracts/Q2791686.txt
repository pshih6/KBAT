Ayelet Shaked (; Hebrew: איילת שקד‎; born 7 May 1976) is an Israeli politician, activist, and software engineer. She served as a member of the Knesset for The Jewish Home from 2013 to 2018, after which she became a member of the New Right. She currently represents the Yamina alliance. She was Minister of Justice from 2015 to 2019. Although until 2018 she was representing a religious party, Shaked identifies as a secular politician.
She began her career in the Tel Aviv high-tech industry, working as an engineer at Texas Instruments. In 2010 she established the My Israel extra-parliamentary movement with Naftali Bennett and led it until May 2012. In 2019, she established the New Right together with Bennett. After the party did not pass the electoral threshold in the April 2019 Israeli election, Shaked planned to join Likud, but Miri Regev did not allow her to do so. However, following Benjamin Netanyahu's failure to form a coalition government and the pending September 2019 election, Shaked ended up succeeding Bennett as the chairwoman of the New Right and later became the leader of the Yamina alliance.She is considered one of Israel's most active and influential legislators, and initiated and drafted laws including Israel's 2016 NGO law, its comprehensive law against terrorism, a version of the basic law proposal on Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people, as well as a law limiting the powers of the Israeli Supreme Court.
