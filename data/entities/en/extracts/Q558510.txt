John Zachary DeLorean (January 6, 1925 â€“ March 19, 2005) was an American engineer, inventor, and executive in the U.S. automobile industry, most widely known for his work at General Motors and as founder of the DeLorean Motor Company.DeLorean managed development of a number of vehicles throughout his career, including the Pontiac GTO muscle car, the Pontiac Firebird, Pontiac Grand Prix, Chevrolet Cosworth Vega, and the DMC DeLorean sports car, which was featured in the 1985 film Back to the Future. He was the youngest division head in General Motors history, then broke away to start the DeLorean Motor Company (DMC) in 1973. However, production delays meant that DMC's first car did not reach the consumer market until 1981, where a depressed buying market was compounded by lukewarm reviews from critics and the public. After a year, the DeLorean had failed to recoup its $175 million in investment costs, unsold cars were accumulating, and the company was in dire financial straits.In October 1982, DeLorean was charged with cocaine trafficking after FBI informant James Hoffman solicited him as financier in a scheme to sell 220 lb (100 kg) of cocaine worth approximately $24 million. DMC was insolvent at the time and in debt for $17 million. Hoffman had approached DeLorean, a man whom he barely knew with no prior criminal record, and DeLorean was able to successfully defend himself at trial under the procedural defense of police entrapment. The trial ended in a not guilty verdict in August 1984, by which time DMC had already shut down after declaring bankruptcy.
