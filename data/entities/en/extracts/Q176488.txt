Halloween: Resurrection (also known as Halloween 8: Resurrection) is a 2002 American horror film directed by Rick Rosenthal, who had also directed Halloween II in 1981. Larry Brand and Sean Hood devised the screenplay. The film stars Busta Rhymes, Bianca Kajlich, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Ryan Merriman, Sean Patrick Thomas, Tyra Banks and Jamie Lee Curtis. The eighth installment in the Halloween franchise and the final installment in the original series, it follows Michael Myers continuing his murderous rampage in his hometown of Haddonfield, when his old, derelict childhood home is used for a live internet horror show.
Halloween: Resurrection was released on July 12, 2002 to largely negative reviews, with many considering it to be an unnecessary sequel to Halloween H20: 20 Years Later. Despite the film's negative reception, Resurrection was a minor box office success, earning $37.6 million. Although another sequel was planned to follow Resurrection, the next film in the franchise would be Halloween, a 2007 remake directed by Rob Zombie. In 2018, a new Halloween film was released that served as a direct-sequel to the original 1978 film, effectively retconning all other Halloween sequels, including this film.
