Shipbuilding is the construction of ships and other floating vessels.  It normally takes place in a specialized facility known as a shipyard.  Shipbuilders, also called shipwrights, follow a specialized occupation that traces its roots to before recorded history.
Shipbuilding and ship repairs, both commercial and military, are referred to as "naval engineering".  The construction of boats is a similar activity called boat building.
The dismantling of ships is called ship breaking.
