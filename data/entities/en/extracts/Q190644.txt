The Central Committee of German Catholics (German: Zentralkomitee der deutschen Katholiken, ZdK) is lay body comprising representatives of various Catholic organisations in Germany. They organise the Catholic Days in Germany. The organisation is headquartered in Bonn.
Its predecessor, the Catholic Society of Germany (German: Katholische Verein Deutschlands), was founded in 1848 by Charles, 6th Prince of LÃ¶wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg, who served as its first President. In 1952, it was renamed the Central Committee of German Catholics. In 2000 a conservative organizaton, the Forum of German Catholics, was founded in opposition to the committee.
In May 2015 the Central Committee of German Catholics voted in favour of blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches.
