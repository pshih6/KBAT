Virginia Christine (March 5, 1920 â€“ July 24, 1996) was an American stage, radio, film, television, and voice actress. Though Christine had a long career as a character actress in film and television, she is probably best remembered as "Mrs. Olson" (or the "Folgers Coffee Woman") in a number of television commercials for Folgers Coffee during the 1960s and '70s.
