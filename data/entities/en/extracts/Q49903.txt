All Good Things was filmed between April and July 2008 in Connecticut and New York. Originally scheduled for a July 24, 2009 release, the film ultimately received a limited release in December 3, 2010.Durst professed admiration for the film and, after previously not cooperating with journalists, offered to be interviewed by Jarecki. Durst would ultimately sit with Jarecki for more than 20 hours over a multi-year period, which led to the six-part documentary miniseries The Jinx in 2015.
