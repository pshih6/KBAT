Paul Hofmann (20 November 1912 in Vienna â€“ 30 December 2008) was an Austrian, later American, author, journalist, linguist, and political activist. The New York Times, for whom he was a foreign correspondent, described him as fluent in German, Italian, French, and English, and having a command of several other languages that was more than passable, as well as "a broad grasp of history and diplomatic affairs and an often playful curiosity".
