Ezequiel Cabeza De Baca (November 1, 1864 â€“ February 18, 1917) was the first Hispano elected for office as lieutenant governor in New Mexico's first election. His term as lieutenant governor was followed by his election as the second elected governor of New Mexico. This term was brief as he died shortly after taking office. He was the state's first elected Hispanic governor, and the first governor born in New Mexico after its annexation by the United States.
