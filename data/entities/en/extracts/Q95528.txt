Maltzahn participated in the Austro-Prussian War (1866) and the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) as a cavalry officer. In 1871 he became a member of the Reichstag for the constituency of Anklam-Demmin, and was made chairman of the household committee. In 1875, he received the title Freiherr. From 1888 to 1893, he was Finance Minister of the German Empire. In 1900 he took over the task of Oberpräsident of Pomerania in Stettin (Szczecin) and held this office until 1911.
