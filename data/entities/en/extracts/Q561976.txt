Edgar Lindenau Aabye (September 14, 1865 â€“ April 30, 1941) was a Danish athlete and journalist who earned a gold medal in the tug of war at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, France.
Aabye was an accomplished athlete who had previously won a Danish championship in swimming (1896) and been a competitor in rowing and cycling. Aabye joined the team which then competed in the only tug-of-war contest, defeating the French team for the gold medal. Initially, Aabye was not a member of the tug-of-war team but was working at the Paris Olympics as a journalist for the Politiken newspaper.  When a member of the combined Dano-Swedish tug of war team was injured, the team asked Aabye to fill in as a last-minute substitute.
