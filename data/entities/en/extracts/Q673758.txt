Arkona (Russian: Аркона) is a Russian folk metal band. Their lyrics are heavily influenced by Russian folklore and Slavic mythology, and their music incorporates several traditional Russian musical instruments. The name of the band "Arkona" refers to the last Pre-Christianized Slavic city-castle.
Their singer and songwriter, Maria "Masha Scream" Arkhipova, is one of relatively few successful female vocalists to sing in a death growl style. She is married to fellow band member Sergei "Lazar" Atrashkevich, with whom she has two children.
