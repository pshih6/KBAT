Hans Lufft (1495â€“1584) was a German printer and publisher, commonly called "the Bible Printer," because in 1534 he printed at Wittenberg the first complete edition of Luther's Bible, in two quarto volumes with illuminations in gold and colors by Lucas Cranach. Lufft printed in the 40 years following more than 100,000 copies of the German Bible. He also printed most of the other works of Luther.
