León Ferrari (September 3, 1920 – July 25, 2013) was an Argentine contemporary conceptual artist. During his extended art career (1954-2013),  his artworks often protested the Argentinian government, the imperialist west, and the Church. Ferrari is probably most famous for artwork "Western and Christian Civilization," which is a 6 foot, plastic United States fighter jet hanging nose-down upon which a crucified Christ hangs. Ferrari caused protests throughout his career, notably from the now-sitting Pope Francis.
