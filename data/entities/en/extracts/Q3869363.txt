NASA Astronaut Group 16 ("The Sardines") was a group of 44 astronauts announced by NASA on May 1, 1996.  The class was nicknamed "The Sardines" for being such a large class, humorously implying that their training sessions would be as tightly packed as sardines in a can.  These 44 candidates compose the largest astronaut class to date.  NASA selected so many candidates in preparation for the anticipated need for ISS crew members, along with regular shuttle needs.
