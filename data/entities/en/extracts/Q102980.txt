Conrad Roland (born Konrad Roland Lehmann in 1934) is a German architect and pioneer of the construction of spacenets (tensile structures), which primarily are to be found as rope climbing frames on playgrounds. In 1978 he designed and constructed the biggest spacenet of the world until today, the Super Four Mast Spacenet, for the Federal Horticultural Show (BUGA).
