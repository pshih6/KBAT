Lotte Toberentz, born Maria Charlotte Toberentz (May 27, 1900 – date of death unknown) was the head overseer of the Uckermark concentration camp for girls in its early years. From December 1944 to April 1945 she was Lagerführerin (camp leader) of the Ravensbrück concentration camp.
She was tried in the Third Ravensbrück Trials at Hamburg in 1948 for her role as Camp Leader at Uckermark. She was acquitted of all crimes due to a lack of evidence. However, the indictment included only crimes against Allied nationals and German non-conformist girls and young women prisoners. It is clear that she was not tried for crimes in Ravensbrueck Concentration Camp. Freed after the trial, Toberentz became an official in the German police force.
There is evidence of SS Wardress complicity in the crimes of the Camp Administration. "In late 1944, SS women in Ravensbrueck set up next to the crematorium a provisional gas chamber. Here the SS from late Jan to April 1945 gassed 5 to 6,000 detainees." Also, the US Holocaust Museum shows that "in late March 1945, the SS transported about 5,600 female prisoners from Ravensbrück to the Mauthausen and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps. In April 1945, the SS guards forced about 20,000 female prisoners, as well as most of the remaining male prisoners, on a brutal and forced evacuation on foot toward northern Mecklenberg."
