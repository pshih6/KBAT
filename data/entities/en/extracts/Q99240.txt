Jacob Gotfried Haafner (Halle, 13 May 1754 â€“ Amsterdam, 4 September 1809) was a German-Dutch travel writer who lived in and wrote extensively on India and Sri Lanka. His travelogues were noted for their Romantic undertones, lively descriptions of Indian cultures and peoples, as well as criticisms of European colonialism, slavery, and cultural domination. 
In 1805, Haafner entered the annual essay contest organized by Teylers Eerste Genootschap (English: Teylers Theological Society). His anti-colonialist, counter-missionary treatise, titled Onderzoek naar het nut der zendelingen en zendelings-genootschappen (English: Examination of the usefulness of missionaries and missionary societies), was selected as winner and published in 1807 amidst public consternation.
