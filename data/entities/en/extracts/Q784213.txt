Her newest publication is the 30 September 2007 collection of 41 new poems in Polish titled deadline.

Some of her poems have been translated into English by Marek Ługowski and circulated and discussed on Usenet's rec.arts.poems. Her prepared 40-poem English-language debut is still awaiting a publisher.
