Klaus Traube (25 February 1928 â€“ 4 September 2016) was a German engineer and former manager in the German nuclear power industry and one of its leading opponents. He was the victim of an illegal eavesdropping operation by the BfV (the German secret service), because he was falsely suspected of passing on secret information to people sympathizing with terrorism, notably the Red Army Faction.
