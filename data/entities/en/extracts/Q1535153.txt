A superhero film, superhero movie or superhero motion picture is a film that is focused on the actions of one or more superheroes: individuals who usually possess extraordinary - generally superhuman - abilities relative to a normal person and are dedicated to protecting the public. These films typically feature action, adventure, fantasy or science fiction elements, with the first film of a particular character often including a focus on the origin of their special powers and their first confrontation with their most famous supervillain or archenemy.
Most superhero films are based on superhero comics. By contrast, several films such as the RoboCop series, The Meteor Man,  the Unbreakable film series, The Incredibles, Hancock and They Call Me Jeeg are original for the screen, while The Green Hornet is based primarily on the original radio series and its 1960s television adaptation, both Underdog and The Powerpuff Girls are based on animated television series, and Japanese tokusatsu and anime superhero films are based on manga and television shows.
Beginning in the 2000s, the superhero film has become a dominant form worldwide. The most notable and successful superhero films since the year 2000 are 20th Century Fox's X-Men franchise, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, Pixar's The Incredibles series,  Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy, the films set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe starting with Iron Man and the films set in the DC Extended Universe starting with Man of Steel. This commercial dominance has largely been accompanied by positive critical notice for many of these films, which includes Academy Award recognition. Superhero films have been commercially successful in a wide variety of genres such as action, horror, fantasy, comedy etc.
