Bootham School is an independent Quaker boarding school in the city of York in North Yorkshire, England. It accepts boys and girls ages 3â€“19, and had an enrolment of 605 pupils in 2016. There is also Bootham Junior School down the road commonly known as BJS.
The school was founded by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and opened on 6 January 1823 in Lawrence Street, York. Its first headmaster was William Simpson (1823-1828). He was followed by John Ford (1828-c.1865). The school is now on Bootham, near York Minster, in a building originally built in 1804 for Sir Richard Vanden Bempde Johnstone.
The school's motto Membra Sumus Corporis Magni means "We are members of a greater body", quoting Seneca the Younger (Epistle 95, 52).
