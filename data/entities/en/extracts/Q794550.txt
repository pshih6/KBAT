Arthemesia was a Finnish black metal band active between 1994 and 2010. The band derives their name from Artemisia absinthium, Latin for wormwood, thought to have many spiritual qualities. Their music mainly concerns a projection of the band's philosophy, namely glorification of the occult and Satanism, but also nature and Shamanism.
The band was formed in 1994, originally under the name Celestial Agony, by vocalist Valtias Mustatuuli and guitarist Routa, but did not record their first demo until 1998, by which time the band included Jari "Arbaal" Mäenpää (guitar), Jukka-Pekka Miettinen (bass), and Oliver Fokin (drums). The band's first album, Devs Iratvs was compiled from several demos they had recorded prior to its release in 2001. A first proper studio album, ShamaNatahs, was released in 2004. Mäenpää  left to form a new band named Wintersun.
