The Belarusian People's Republic (Belarusian: Белару́ская Наро́дная Рэспу́бліка, [bʲeɫaˈruskaja naˈrodnaja rɛsˈpublʲika], transliterated as Biełarúskaja Naródnaja Respúblika, BNR;Russian: Белору́сская Наро́дная Респу́блика, romanized: Belorusskaja Narodnaja Respublika), historically referred to as the White Ruthenian Democratic Republic (German: Weißruthenische Volksrepublik) was a failed attempt to create a Belarusian state on the territory controlled by the German Imperial Army during World War I. The BNR existed from 1918 to 1919.
The BNR was declared on March 9, 1918, in Minsk by the members of the Executive Committee of the First All-Belarusian Congress, and two weeks later, on March 25, 1918, it proclaimed independence. In 1919, it co-existed with an alternative Communist government of Belarus (the Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia, which later became part of the Lithuanian–Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic), moving its seat of government to Vilnius and Hrodna, but ceased to exist due to the capture of the whole Belarusian territory by Polish and Bolshevik forces during the Polish–Soviet War of 1919-1921. Currently, its government in exile, the Rada (Council) of the Belarusian People's Republic is the oldest still functioning government in exile.
