In a career that spanned a quarter of a century, Harvey appeared in stage, film and television productions primarily in the United Kingdom and  the United States. His performance in Room at the Top (1959) resulted in an Academy Award nomination.

He also appeared as the brainwashed Raymond Shaw in The Manchurian Candidate (1962).
