Roland Freisler (30 October 1893 – 3 February 1945) was a German Nazi jurist, judge, and politician who served as the State Secretary of the Reich Ministry of Justice from 1934 to 1942 and President of the People's Court from 1942 to 1945.
He was a prominent ideologist of National Socialism who influenced the Nazification of Germany's legal system as a jurist, and attended the Wannsee Conference which set in motion the Holocaust. He was appointed President of the People's Court in 1942, overseeing the prosecution of notable political crimes as a judge, for which he became infamous for his aggressive personality, humiliation of defendants, and frequent sentencing with the death penalty.
Although the death penalty was abolished with the creation of the Federal Republic, he is also notable as defining murder in German law in 1941, which survives to date in the Strafgesetzbuch § 211.
