Joachim, Count of Schönburg-Glauchau (German: Joachim Heinrich Maria Carl Rudolf Franz Xaver Joseph Antonius Christophorus Hubertus Alfons Graf von Schönburg-Glauchau; 4 February 1929 in Glauchau, Saxony – 29 September 1998 in Passau, Bavaria) was the nominal successor head of the former mediatised German Counts of Schönburg-Glauchau until 1945. Dispossessed and expelled from his homeland in 1945, he and his family migrated to the Rhineland, where he was an author and journalist.  After the fall of the Berlin Wall, he returned to his homeland, represented the district in the Bundestag, and served in local government.
