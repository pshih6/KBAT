Jeffrey Nero Hardy (born August 31, 1977) is an American professional wrestler and musician. He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand.
Hardy is best known for his work in his multiple runs with WWE. He also worked for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), Ring of Honor (ROH), and several companies on the independent circuit. Before gaining prominence in the WWE, Hardy, along with his real life brother Matt Hardy, ran and performed for the Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (OMEGA). The Hardy Boyz worked as enhancement talents for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from 1994, and were signed to full-time contracts in 1998. They gained notoriety in the tag team division, partly due to their participation in Tables, Ladders and Chairs matches. With the addition of Lita, the team became known as Team Xtreme and continued to rise in popularity. Alongside Matt, he has held twelve world tag team championships between WWE, TNA and ROH.
Hardy has had success as a singles wrestler, capturing his first of six world championships, the WWE Championship in 2008 and going on to hold WWE's World Heavyweight Championship twice and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship three times. He has also won the WWE Intercontinental Championship four times, the WWE Hardcore Championship three times and the WWE European, Light Heavyweight, and United States Championships once each. He is the 18th Triple Crown Champion and 9th Grand Slam Champion in WWE history (one of five men to complete both WWE Grand Slam formats, and one of two to win all original Grand Slam titles).
Hardy is involved in motocross, music, painting and other artistic endeavors. He is currently a member of the band PeroxWhy?Gen, with whom he has released three studio albums and three extended plays. In 2003, Hardy, along with his brother Matt, co-wrote an autobiographical book of memoirs titled The Hardy Boyz. Their book was a New York Times best seller.
