Juliane Köhler (born 6 August 1965) is a German theatre, television and film actress.
Köhler was born in Göttingen to a puppeteer. During 1985–1988 she studied under Uta Hagen in New York City and attended HB Studio. She also received ballet instruction in Munich. Since her first appearance at Hanover's Lower Saxon State Theatre in 1988, she has regularly appeared in German theatre productions. She performed in an ensemble cast of the Bavarian State Theatre during 1993–1997. She left the company because her filming of Aimée & Jaguar interfered with rehearsals for a production of Das Käthchen von Heilbronn. She later returned to Munich to participate with the Munich Kammerspiele.
She has starred in the 1999 film Aimée & Jaguar (as Lilly Wust, or Aimée); the 2001 film Nowhere in Africa (as Jettel Redlich); the 2004 film Downfall (as Eva Braun); the 2008 film Haber as Clara, the wife of Fritz Shimon Haber; Christina in Eden Is West (2009) and starred in Two Lives (2012) as Katrine Evensen Myrdal.
