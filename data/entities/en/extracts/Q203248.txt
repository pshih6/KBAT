Kim Yoon-ji (English name: Christine Kim; Hangul: 김윤지) is a Korean–American actress and former singer based in the Republic of Korea. She performed under the stage name NS Yoon-G (Hangul: NS윤지) and debuted in 2009 with the digital single "Head Hurts" under JTM Entertainment. She is now with VAST Entertainment. The "NS" in her name initially stood for "New Spirit", but was later changed to "New Star". Yoon-ji used her Korean name as a part of her stage name as she found "Christine" too difficult for Korean people to pronounce.
