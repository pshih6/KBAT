St. Stephen's College is a constituent college of the University of Delhi. Widely regarded as one of the oldest college for arts and sciences in India, the institution has produced distinguished alumni in fields like politics, law, journalism, film, and business. It was established by the Cambridge Mission to Delhi. The college admits both undergraduates and post-graduates, and awards degrees in liberal arts and sciences under the purview of the University of Delhi. In 2017, the governing body of the college unilaterally initiated a move towards making it an autonomous institution. In 2018, the plan was put on hold after the University Grants Commission received legal advice against passing a favourable decision.
