The film is a remake of Menon's own Tamil film Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa (2010) and features a reused soundtrack and film score composed by A. R. Rahman, while the cinematography and editing were handled by M. S. Prabhu and Anthony Gonsalves, respectively. Singer Chinmayi provided the talking voice of the female lead, reprising her role from the Tamil version and the Telugu simultaneously made version where she dubbed for actresses Trisha Krishnan and Samantha Ruth Prabhu respectively.
While in production, the film was titled Prem Katha, but was renamed as Ekk Deewana Tha, as the director wanted an abstract title for the film, similar to the original.The film, produced by Fox Star Studios, a subsidiary of Hollywood studio 20th Century Fox, Photon Kathaas and RS Infotainment, was released on 17 February 2012 in two different versions with a number of endings to suit the taste of regional viewers. The film opened to universally mixed reviews and had a lukewarm reception at the box office.
