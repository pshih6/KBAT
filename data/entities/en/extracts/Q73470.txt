Horst Dassler (12 March 1936 – 9 April 1987) was the son of Adolf "Adi" Dassler, known as the "shoemaker of the nation," as a result of the extensive sales of Adidas brand sports shoes by the company he founded (until 1948 known as Gebrüder Dassler) in 1924. Horst Dassler eventually became chairman of Adidas, and at the time of his death it was the world's largest sporting goods manufacturer with affiliates in 40 nations. Horst himself was known as the father of sports sponsorship as a result of his separate business of managing rights for the world governing bodies of football and the Olympics.
