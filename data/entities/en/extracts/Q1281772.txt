Helen Kane (born Helen Clare Schroeder, August 4, 1904 â€“ September 26, 1966) was an American singer and actress. Her signature song was "I Wanna Be Loved by You" (1928), featured in the musical film "Good Boy". Kane's voice and appearance were a source for Fleischer Studios animator Grim Natwick when creating Betty Boop. Kane attempted to sue the studio for claims of stealing her signature "boop-a-doop" style. However, it was revealed that Kane copied that style from Harlem jazz singer Baby Esther leading to the case's dismissal.
