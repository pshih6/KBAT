Dog Day Afternoon is a 1975 American neo-noir crime drama film directed by Sidney Lumet, written by Frank Pierson, and produced by Martin Bregman and Martin Elfand. Starring Al Pacino, John Cazale, James Broderick, and Charles Durning, it chronicles the events following a bank robbery committed by Sonny Wortzik (Pacino) and Salvatore Naturale (Cazale).Inspired by a Life magazine article "The Boys in the Bank" by P. F. Kluge, Dog Day Afternoon is largely a dramatization of the 1972 bank robbery masterminded by John Wojtowicz. Despite this, Wojtowicz claimed a number of the film's events contained inaccuracies. Dog Day Afternoon is notable for its anti-establishment tone, and marks the third collaboration between Pacino and Cazale, after The Godfather. It is the final film released in Cazale's lifetime (The Deer Hunter was released after his death), and its title refers to the sultry "dog days" of summer.
The film contains no musical score, bar the appearance of three diegetic songs. The majority of Dog Day Afternoon was shot on location in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn; near the site of the actual bank robbery. Although the film follows the basic text of the script as written by Pierson, Lumet encouraged the actors to improvise and workshop scenes to facilitate naturalistic dialogue.Dog Day Afternoon was released in the United States on September 21, 1975, and received universal acclaim for the performances of its cast, its directing, and its screenplay. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards and seven Golden Globe awards, and won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. In 2009, Dog Day Afternoon was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the Library of Congress, and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.
