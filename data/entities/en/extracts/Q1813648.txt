Timi Hansen (28 October 1958 â€“ 4 November 2019) was a Danish bass player. He played in the Danish heavy metal band Mercyful Fate from 1981 to 1985 and from 1992 to 1993, and its successor project King Diamond from 1985 to 1987.He played with his fingers rather than with a guitar pick.
Many have asked about how Hansen acquired "Grabber" as a nickname. Timi apparently used to play a Gibson G3 Grabber. A music store clerk began to call him "Grabber" and the name stuck. Aware that the meaning might be misunderstood, he slowly changed his stage name, Timi Grabber, back to his real name, Timi Hansen.
