Michael Rodenberg, nickname Miro (born 9 April 1970, in Wolfsburg) is a German keyboard player and musical producer known for working with power metal bands such as Angra, Shaaman, Luca Turilli, Rhapsody of Fire, Kamelot and Heavens Gate. He mainly works in conjunction with his some-time bandmate Sascha Paeth.
In addition to his production work, Miro has made guest appearances for many of the bands he works with as a keyboard player, and also provides orchestral arrangements. He served a particularly long period as a guest of Kamelot, providing all keyboards on their studio albums from 1999 until 2005, when they hired the tour musician Oliver Palotai as a full-time member.
In 2004, he participated in Aina, a metal opera featuring many guest heavy metal musicians.
In 2007, he and Sacha Paeth helped to relaunch Tobias Sammet's metal opera Avantasia, with the albums of The Wicked Trilogy (on which Miro played most of the keyboard parts and orchestrations) and also leading it to have a live band and play world tours.
