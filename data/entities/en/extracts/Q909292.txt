Sonet Records is a jazz/pop record label operating as an imprint of Universal Music Sweden. It was founded in Sweden in 1956.
Sonet Records was established by Sven Lindholm and Gunnar Bergstr√∂m, who managed the label into the 1980s. Dag Haeggqvist, the owner of Gazell Records, became an executive of the label in 1960, and Sonet eventually acquired Gazell's catalogue. The label set up offices throughout Europe and expanded into film, video, and other visual arts in addition to music. It acquired the Danish label Storyville Records at some point. The label released both new material and reissues, many by Scandinavian artists in addition to albums by American jazz musicians and some non-jazz material such as pop and rock music. It was distributed by Pickwick Records in North America in the 1960s, where it was involved in releasing some of Bill Haley's latter-day material, among other things.
Sonet Records was acquired by PolyGram in 1991.
