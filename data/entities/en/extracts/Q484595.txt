Anal Cunt, also known as AxCx and A.C., was an American grindcore band that formed in Newton, Massachusetts in 1988. From its inception, the band underwent a number of line-up changes under Seth Putnam's leadership and had a distinctive vocals-guitar-drummer configuration; unusually for the metal genre they never had a bass guitarist. Known for playing short, fast songs with an abrasive musical style and intentionally controversial lyrics, Anal Cunt released eight full-length studio albums in addition to a number of compilations and extended plays. Anal Cunt disbanded in 2011 after Putnam died of a suspected heart attack.They have been categorized as grindcore, noisecore, noisegrind and hardcore. The band is often referred to by their initials A.C. (often written as AxCx) due to the offensive nature of their name and censorship limits on some radio and publications, and many of their album covers simply display the initials A. C. However, the band managed to subvert even this abbreviation by drawing these letters in a manner resembling an anus and a vulva. Their early material contained no pre-written lyrics or music. Rather, the band developed an entirely improvised style which consisted of extremely loud, fast, and aggressive noise. Over the years, the band eventually shifted their style and slowly began to incorporate more riffs and pre-written lyrics into their songs. It was not until then that the band earned the reputation for intentionally being outrageous and offensive. In 2010, they released a "cock rock" album entitled Fuckin' A. An album of material similar to their old grindcore albums called Wearing Out Our Welcome was released digitally in 2010.
