Werner Blankenburg (19 June 1905 – 28 November 1957) was head of the Section IIa in Hitler's Chancellery (Kanzlei des Führers) in Nazi Germany, and thus one of the main responsible persons for the National Socialist "Euthanasia"-program Action T4, the annihilation of the Polish Jews in the "Aktion Reinhard", and the experiments with castration by X-Rays in KZ Auschwitz-Birkenau.
