Pope Conon (died 21 September 687) was the bishop of Rome from 21 October 686 to his death. He had been put forward as a compromise candidate, there being a conflict between the two factions resident in Romeâ€” the military and the clerical. He consecrated the Irish missionary Kilian and commissioned him to preach in Franconia.
