Cat Chaser is a 1989 film directed by Abel Ferrara and starring Peter Weller and Kelly McGillis, based on the novel of the same name by Elmore Leonard. It was adapted from the novel by Leonard and James Borelli.
A three-hour raw cut of "Cat Chaser" was screened at Anthology Film Archives in New York City in the summer of 2014. Ferrara, Weller and others involved are very unhappy with the released version, particularly with the added omniscient narration (Weller refused to provide this narration, so producers Peter Davis and William Panzer hired actor Reni Santoni instead).
