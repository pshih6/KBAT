Šempeter pri Gorici (pronounced [ʃɛmˈpeːtəɾ pɾi ɡɔˈɾiːtsi] (listen) or [ʃəmˈpeːtəɾ pɾi ɡɔˈɾiːtsi]; Italian: San Pietro di Gorizia) is a town and the administrative centre of the Municipality of Šempeter-Vrtojba in the Slovene Littoral region of Slovenia. There is a border crossing into the Italian town of Gorizia. The crossing is known as San Pietro di Gorizia in Italian.
Through most of its history, it was linked to the town of Gorizia (Slovene: Gorica), which is now in Italy, whence also its name, literally meaning 'St. Peter near Gorizia'.  Since 1947, it has been gravitating towards the newly established town of Nova Gorica, with which it forms a continuous conurbation.
