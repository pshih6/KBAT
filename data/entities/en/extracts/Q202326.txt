The Godfather Part III is a 1990 American crime film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from the screenplay co-written with Mario Puzo. It is the third and final installment in The Godfather trilogy. A sequel to The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather Part II (1974), it completes the story of Michael Corleone, the patriarch of the Corleone family, who attempts to legitimize his criminal empire. The film also includes fictionalized accounts of two real-life events: the 1978 death of Pope John Paul I and the Papal banking scandal of 1981–82, both linked to Michael Corleone's business affairs. The film stars Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Andy García, Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna, Bridget Fonda, George Hamilton, and Sofia Coppola.
Coppola and Puzo preferred the title The Death of Michael Corleone; Paramount Pictures found that unacceptable. Coppola considers the series as two films with Part III as the epilogue. The Godfather Part III received generally positive reviews, albeit less than the critical acclaim that the first two films received. The film was distributed by the same company as the first two films, Paramount Pictures, premiering in Beverly Hills on December 20, 1990, and released in the United States on December 25, 1990. It grossed $136,766,062 and was nominated for seven Academy Awards, failing to win any, the only film in the trilogy to do so.
