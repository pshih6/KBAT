Masters of Reality is an American rock band formed in 1981 by frontman Chris Goss and guitarist Tim Harrington in Syracuse, New York, United States. They took the name for the band from a misprinted label of the third Black Sabbath album. Goss has remained the only constant band member. 
The band's music has touched on many styles, ranging from hard rock to blues, from progressive rock to Beatlesque pop music. The band is sometimes associated with the "Palm Desert Scene",  which includes bands like Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age and many other stoner rock and "desert rock" bands.
Frontman Chris Goss is also a notable producer (Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age, UNKLE, Soulwax, Melissa Auf der Maur, The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster) and has contributed to many other bands in the Palm Desert Scene and beyond.
