Maryanne Amacher (February 25, 1938 â€“ October 22, 2009) was an American composer and installation artist.
She is known for working extensively with a family of psychoacoustic phenomena called auditory distortion products (also known as distortion product otoacoustic emissions and combination tones), in which the ears themselves produce audible sound.
