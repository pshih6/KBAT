Davos (UK: , US: ; German: [daˈfoːs] or [daˈvoːs] (listen); Romansh: Tavau; archaic Italian: Tavate) is an Alpine town, and a municipality in the Prättigau/Davos Region in the canton of Graubünden, Switzerland. It has a permanent population of 10,899 (2018). Davos is located on the river Landwasser, in the Rhaetian Alps, between the Plessur and Albula Range at 1,560 m (5,120 ft) above sea level.
The former Alpine resort village consists of two parts: Davos Dorf (literally: "Davos village") to the northeast towards Klosters and further down through the Prättigau to Landquart, and Davos Platz (literally: "place") to the southwest, which opens into the valley of the river Landwasser and eventually leads to Filisur.
During summer season the Flüela Pass leads south-east into the Lower Engadine.
Davos plays host to the World Economic Forum (WEF), an annual meeting of global political and business elites (often referred to simply as "Davos"), and has one of Switzerland's biggest ski resorts. At the end of every year it serves as the site of the annual Spengler Cup ice-hockey tournament, hosted by the HC Davos local hockey team.
