Sir Hugh Carleton Greene  (15 November 1910 â€“ 19 February 1987) was a British television executive and journalist. He was director-general of the BBC from 1960 to 1969.
After working for newspapers in the 1930s, Greene spent most of his later career with the BBC, rising through the managerial ranks of overseas broadcasting and then news for the main domestic channels. He encountered opposition from some politicians and activists opposed to his modernising agenda, but under his leadership the BBC was recognised to be outperforming its commercial rival, ITV, and was awarded a second television channel (BBC 2) by the British government and authorised to introduce colour television to Britain.
After retiring from the BBC, Greene published several books,  including a collaboration with his brother, the novelist Graham Greene, and made television programmes both for the BBC and its commercial rival.
