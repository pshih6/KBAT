Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is a 1997 American science fantasy martial arts action film directed by John R. Leonetti. A sequel to the 1995 film Mortal Kombat, based on the video game series Mortal Kombat by Midway Games, it stars Robin Shou, Talisa Soto, Brian Thompson, Sandra Hess, 
Lynn "Red" Williams, Irina Pantaeva, Marjean Holden, Musetta Vander, and James Remar. Although the story picks up immediately when the last film ended, all the roles were recast, with the exception of Shou and Soto.
The film's storyline was largely an adaptation of the fighting game Mortal Kombat 3. The plot follows an alliance of heroic Kombatants who are led by Raiden as they stop at nothing to save the Earthrealm by engaging in a series of fights with the villainous Kombatants of the Outworld who form an alliance of their own as well that is brought together by the evil tyrant Shao Kahn.
Annihilation has been near-universally panned by both fans and critics, resulting in a third film being cancelled.
