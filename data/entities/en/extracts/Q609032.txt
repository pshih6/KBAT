Joseph William Castillo (born March 30, 1966) is an American musician and songwriter. He is best known for being the drummer of the hard rock band Queens of the Stone Age from 2002 to 2012. He has also been a member of Danzig, Eagles of Death Metal, California Breed, Zilch, and Scott Weiland and the Wildabouts.
Castillo joined Queens of the Stone Age in 2002, following the departure of temporary drummer Dave Grohl. He recorded two studio albums, Lullabies to Paralyze (2005), Era Vulgaris (2007), and recorded half of ...Like Clockwork (2013) before being fired by founding member Josh Homme during the process. 
Since leaving Queens of the Stone Age and Homme side project Eagles of Death Metal in 2012, Castillo joined California Breed, replacing founding member Jason Bonham, joined Scott Weiland and the Wildabouts, touring with the band before the singer's death in 2015, and joined three groups with former Queens of the Stone Age bandmate Nick Oliveri: supergroups Bloodclot (with John Joseph of Cro-Mags and Todd Youth, former Danzig and Murphy's Law guitarist), Royale Daemons (with Wino), and historic punk band Bl'ast. Castillo also has joined Zakk Wylde-led Black Sabbath cover band Zakk Sabbath.
Currently, Joey is touring with The Bronx, after founding member Jorma Vik left to play with Eagles of Death Metal.
