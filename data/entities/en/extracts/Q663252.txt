Horatio Frederick Phillips (born 1845 in Streatham, Surrey â€“ 1924) was an English aviation pioneer. He was famous for building multiplane flying machines with many more sets of lifting surfaces than are normal on modern aircraft. However he made a more lasting contribution to aeronautics in his work on aerofoil design.
