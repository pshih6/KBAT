13 Assassins (Japanese: 十三人の刺客, Hepburn: Jūsannin no Shikaku) is a 2010 samurai martial arts film directed by Takashi Miike; it is a remake of Eiichi Kudo's 1963 Japanese period drama film 13 Assassins. Loosely based on historical events, the Miike version is set in 1844 toward the end of the Edo period where a group of thirteen assassins—comprising twelve samurai and a hunter—secretly plot to assassinate the savage leader of the Akashi clan, Lord Matsudaira Naritsugu, to thwart his appointment to the powerful Shogunate Council.
The film stars Kōji Yakusho, Takayuki Yamada, Sōsuke Takaoka, Hiroki Matsukata, Kazuki Namioka, and Gorō Inagaki. It is the third film in which Yamada and Takaoka co-starred, the first two being Crows Zero and Crows Zero 2, both directed by Miike. Principal photography took place in the course of two months in Tsuruoka, Yamagata, in northern Japan, in the period from July to September 2009. The film opened in Japan on 25 September 2010 and in the United States on 29 April 2011. Western critics gave the film positive reviews and compared it favourably with Kurosawa's oeuvre.
