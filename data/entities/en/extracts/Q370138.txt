Otello Toso (22 February 1914 â€“ 15 March 1966) was an Italian film and stage actor.
Born in Padua, Toso graduated from the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in 1939 and immediately later he started his film career. He was particularly prolific in the 1940s, in films in which he usually starred negative characters. After World War II Toso mostly starred in melodramas and genre films, except for Juan Antonio Bardem's Death of a Cyclist. He died at 52 in a car accident in Pieve di Curtarolo, near Padua.
