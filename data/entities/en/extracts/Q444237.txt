Honoré Théodore Paul Joseph d'Albert, duc de Luynes (Paris, 15 December 1802 – Rome, 15 December 1867), inheritor of several French titles as duc de Luynes, de Chevreuse et de Chaulnes and an immense fortune, who cut a figure of grand seigneur and supported the exiled comte de Chambord's claim to the throne of France, is remembered most for the collection he gave to the Cabinet des Médailles in 1862.
