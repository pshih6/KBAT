Ely Jacques Kahn (June 1, 1884 â€“ September 5, 1972) was an American commercial architect who designed numerous skyscrapers in New York City in the twentieth century. In addition to buildings intended for commercial use, Kahn's designs ranged throughout the possibilities of architectural programs, including facilities for the film industry. Many of his numerous buildings under the 1916 Zoning Resolution feature architectural setbacks  to keep the building profitably close to its permitted "envelope" and have been likened to the stepped form of the Tower of Babell; a notable example is his 1400 Broadway (1931). Kahn is also known for his guidance to author Ayn Rand.
