Dahlem (German pronunciation ) is a locality of the Steglitz-Zehlendorf borough in southwestern Berlin. Until Berlin's 2001 administrative reform it was a part of the former borough of Zehlendorf.
Dahlem is one of the most affluent parts of the city and a center for academic research. It is home to the Freie Universität Berlin, with its Philological Library ("The Brain") by Norman Foster as a landmark. Several other research institutions; the Jesus-Christus-Kirche, where most of the legendary Berlin Philharmonic recordings were made from the 1950s through the 1980s owing to its fine acoustics; the Berlin Botanical Garden, although officially on the ground of neighbouring Lichterfelde; parts of the Grunewald forest, including its Renaissance hunting lodge built in 1543; and many museums — all are there.
Although Dahlem has a reputation as an idyllic and quiet area, it is busy with students arriving by U-Bahn on weekdays.
