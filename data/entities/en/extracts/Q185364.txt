Keith Omar Murray (born September 13, 1974) is an American rapper from Long Island, New York. Murray grew up on Carleton Ave. in Central Islip, which is located on the South Shore of Long Island in Suffolk County. Murray was a well known member of a local infamous crew known by the acronym L.O.D. (Legion of Doom). Murray is more famously known for being a member of the Hip Hop trio the Def Squad, which includes fellow rappers Redman and fellow Long Island native Erick Sermon, previously the co-founder of the legendary Hip-Hop group EMPD (from neighboring town Brentwood).
Murray debuted his spaced out, complex, multi-syllable rhyming style on Erick Sermon's ruggedly produced song 'Hostile' off his first solo album 'No Pressure' which was released in 1993, and was Sermon's first project since splitting with former rhyming partner Parrish Smith. In 1994, Jive Records released Murray's debut single, The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World which was quickly followed up by his debut album of the same name, released to both critical acclaim and commercial success. Along with his solo work, Murray is known for his association with the Def Squad, with whom he released an album, El Ni√±o in 1998.
