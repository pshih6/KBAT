Justus van Egmont or Joost van Egmont (Leiden, 1601 – Antwerp, 8 January 1674) was a painter and a tapestry designer during the 17th century. After training in Antwerp with Gasper van den Hoecke and working with Antony van Dyck, van Egmont also worked in Peter Paul Rubens' workshop. He moved to France in 1628 where he was a court painter for the House of Orléans. In France he helped to found the Académie de peinture et de sculpture. He later returned to Flanders where he worked in Antwerp and Brussels.  He is mainly known for his portrait paintings, although he also painted some history subjects, and produced designs for five different tapestry series.
