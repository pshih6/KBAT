Charles Hugh "Chuck" Roberson (May 10, 1919 â€“ June 8, 1988) was an American cowboy, actor, and stuntman.  He was nicknamed "Bad Chuck" by director John Ford, for whom he worked many times, to distinguish him from "Good Chuck," stuntman Chuck Hayward.  Roberson was reportedly the rowdier of the two, thus the nicknames.
