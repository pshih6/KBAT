Bernat Fenollar, also Mossèn (Bernat de) Fenollar (Valencian Community, 1438 – Valencia, 28 February 1516) was a poet, cleric and chess player from Valencia, Spain. He was an abbot (the title "Mossèn" was often given to clergymen), had a position both in Valencia Cathedral and the University of Valencia as a professor of mathematics.He is one of the authors of Scachs d'amor or Chess of Love, a poem based on a chess game between Francesc de Castellví and Narcís Vinyoles,  while Bernat Fenollar comments and establishes the rules. It is the first documented game played with the modern rules of chess, at least concerning the moves of the queen and bishop.
