Michele Ferrero (Italian pronunciation: [miˈkɛːle ferˈrɛːro]; 26 April 1925 – 14 February 2015) was an Italian billionaire businessman.  He owned the chocolate manufacturer Ferrero SpA, Europe's second largest confectionery company (at the time of his death), which he developed from the small bakery and café of his father in Alba, Piedmont.  His first big success was adding vegetable oil to the traditional gianduja paste to make the popular spread, Nutella.
