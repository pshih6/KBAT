Manuel Leaonedas Ayulo (October 20, 1921 â€“ May 17, 1955) was an American racecar driver.  His efforts, along with those of friend and teammate Jack McGrath, helped establish track roadsters as viable race cars.  Ayulo was killed in practice for the 1955 Indianapolis 500 when his car crashed straight into a concrete wall.  He was found to have not been wearing a seat belt and his pockets "were filled with wrenches".
