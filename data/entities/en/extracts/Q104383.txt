Siegfried Alfred Rudolf Friedrich von Kardorff (4 February 1873 âˆ’ 12 October 1945) was a German politician.
He was born the son of Wilhelm von Kardorff and followed him in adopting a career in politics. Describing himself as a "left-wing Free Conservative", Kardorff helped found the German National People's Party. At one of its first public meetings in December 1918, Kardorff was the main speaker. He declared: "Our new party, in which friendly right-wing parties have united, has no past and rejects any responsibility for the past. We have a present and, if God will, a good future". Kardorff said that the party would uphold the monarchy, agriculture, the middle class and the church: "But we are not a party of Lutheran orthodoxy, rather we find recognition wherever living Christianity is found".Kardorff later joined the German People's Party and was a member of its "industrial right-wing" according to the historian Stephen G. Fritz.He also composed political biographies of Otto von Bismarck and his father; the latter was praised by G. P. Gooch, Carlton J. H. Hayes and Sidney B. Fay.
