The Saint-Gotthard Massif (German: Gotthardmassiv or Sankt-Gotthard-Massiv)  is a mountain range in the Alps in Switzerland, located at the border of four cantons: Valais, Ticino, Uri and Graub√ºnden. It is delimited by the Nufenen Pass on the west, by the Furka Pass and the Oberalp Pass on the north and by the Lukmanier Pass on the east. The homonymous Gotthard Pass, lying at the heart of the massif, is the main route from north to south (excluding tunnels).
