The Belgian Socialist Party  (French: Parti Socialiste belge, PSB; Dutch: Belgische Socialistische Partij, BSP) was a social-democratic political party which existed in Belgium from 1945 to 1978. During its time in office, a number of progressive social reforms were introduced.The BSP was founded by activists from the Belgian Labour Party (1885â€“1940), which was the first Belgian socialist party. It ceased to function during the Second World War, while Belgium was under Nazi occupation. Its main support bases were the co-operative and trade union movements, and it won relatively more support in Wallonia. Like most Belgian political organisations, the party supported greater integration with the European Economic Community, albeit in a socialist context.As linguistic and community issues became more divisive, the Belgian Socialist Party split into two new entities: the Socialistische Partij for the Flemish community and the Parti Socialiste for the Francophone community.
