Julián Gómez García-Ribera, better known as Julián Gorkin (January 1901, Benifairó de les Valls - 8 August 1987, Paris) was a Spanish revolutionary socialist, writer and a central leader of the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) during the Spanish Civil War. He was a writer of many books on political and cultural themes, as well as novels and some plays. After the Spanish Civil War, he escaped to Mexico where he became a part of the strong anti-Stalinist socialist community there. He helped obtain visas for Victor Serge and his son Vlady to enter Mexico when they had to escape from the Nazis invading France.
By the time he returned to Paris in 1948 he had become an anti-communist. From 1953 to 1963 (with a brief interlude in 1959) he was editor in Paris of the periodical "Cuadernos" published by the CIA front group Congress for Cultural Freedom".
