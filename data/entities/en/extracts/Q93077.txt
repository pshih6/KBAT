Jean Kuntzmann (1 June 1912 – 18 December 1992) was a French mathematician, known for his works in applied mathematics and computer science, pushing and developing both fields at a very early time.
Kuntzmann earned his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Paris under supervision of Georges Valiron (thesis: Contribution à l'étude des systèmes multiformes). In 1960, he established the École nationale supérieure d'informatique et de mathématiques appliquées de Grenoble.
