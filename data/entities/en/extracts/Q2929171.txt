Maryland Stadium is an outdoor athletic stadium on the campus of the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland. It is the home of Maryland Terrapins football and men's lacrosse teams, which compete in the Big Ten Conference. The facility was formerly named Byrd Stadium after Harry "Curley" Byrd, a multi-sport athlete, football coach, and university president in the first half of the 20th century. Due to a student government complaint over Byrd's namesake (Byrd supported a segregated university), the USM Board of Regents renamed the facility "Maryland Stadium" in 2015. Capital One holds the naming rights of the field, having acquired Chevy Chase Bank shortly after the latter purchased naming rights in 2006.
