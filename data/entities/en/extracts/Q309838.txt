Layne Thomas Staley (born Layne Rutherford Staley, August 22, 1967 â€“ April 5, 2002) was an American musician best known as the original lead singer and co-songwriter of the rock band Alice in Chains, which rose to international fame in the early 1990s as part of Seattle's grunge movement, becoming known for Staley's distinct vocal style and tenor voice as well as the harmonized vocals between him and guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell. Staley was also a member of the glam metal bands Sleze and Alice N' Chains, and  the supergroups Mad Season and Class of '99.
From mid-1996 onwards, Staley was out of the public spotlight, never to perform live again. He struggled for much of his adult life with depression and drug addiction, which resulted in his death from a speedball overdose at the age of 34 on April 5, 2002.
Staley was ranked at No. 27 on Hit Parader's list of "Heavy Metal's All-Time Top 100 Vocalists" in 2006, and at No. 42 on Complex's magazine list of "The 50 Best Lead Singers of All Time" in 2012. The city of Seattle officially declared August 22, 2019, as "Layne Staley Day."
