Yury Mikhailovich Luzhkov (Russian: Ю́рий Миха́йлович Лужко́в, IPA: [ˈjʉrʲɪj mʲɪˈxajləvʲɪt͡ɕ lʊˈʂkof]; 21 September 1936 – 10 December 2019) was a Russian politician who served as mayor of Moscow from 1992 to 2010. He was the vice-chairman and one of the founders of the ruling United Russia party.
During Luzhkov's time, Moscow's economy expanded and he presided over large construction projects in the city, including the building of a new financial district. At the same time, he was accused of corruption, bulldozing historic buildings, and poor handling of traffic, as well as the city's smog crisis during the 2010 Russian wildfires. On 28 September 2010, Luzhkov was fired from his post by a decree issued by President Dmitry Medvedev.
However, since Luzhkov’s ousting, no legal cases have been initiated or proof of corruption made public.
