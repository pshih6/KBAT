The University of Pennsylvania Stuart Weitzman School of Design is the design school of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It offers degrees in architecture, landscape architecture, city and regional planning, historic preservation, and fine arts, as well as several dual degrees with other graduate schools at the University of Pennsylvania. Formerly known as PennDesign, it was renamed after Stuart Weitzman donated an undisclosed sum. Students criticized the renaming for the lack of student input, the lack of transparency, and the irrelevance of fashion designer Weitzman to the school's academic curriculum, which does not include fashion design.
