Nikolai Viktorovich Podgorny (Ukrainian: Микола Вікторович Підгорний, Russian: Никола́й Ви́кторович Подго́рный, IPA: [nʲɪkɐˈlaj ˈvʲiktərəvʲɪtɕ pɐdˈgornɨj]; 18 February [O.S. 5 February] 1903 – 12 January 1983) was a Soviet statesman who served as the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the head of state of the Soviet Union, from 1965 to 1977.
Podgorny was born to a Ukrainian working-class family in the city of Karlovka, graduating from a local worker's school in 1926 and the Kiev Technological Institute of Food Industry in 1931. Podgorny became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1930 and climbed up the Soviet hierarchy through the industrial ladder by delivering the production goals set by the bureaucrats of the centrally planned economy. Podgorny became Second Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine in 1953, and was elevated to First Secretary of the party's Central Committee from 1957 to 1963.
Podgorny was elected Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet after the resignation of Anastas Mikoyan in 1965 and ruled the Soviet Union in a troika with Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin following the removal of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Podgorny became the second-most powerful figure in the Soviet Union behind Brezhnev after Kosygin's fall from power in 1968. Podgorny was removed as Chairman of the Presidium in 1977 during Brezhnev's consolidation of power as General Secretary, and later lost his seat in the Politburo. Podgorny was forced to resign from active politics and sidelined in Soviet affairs until he died in 1983.
