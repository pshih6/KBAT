Golden Boy (Japanese: ゴールデンボーイ, Hepburn: Gōruden Bōi) is a Japanese comedy manga series written and illustrated by Tatsuya Egawa about a 25-year-old freeter, pervert, and "travelling student" named Kintaro Oe (大江 錦太郎, Ōe Kintarō). The manga was originally serialized in Shueisha's Super Jump starting in 1991, with the first collected volume released the following year. Parts of the manga were adapted into a six-episode original video animation (OVA) series produced by Shueisha and KSS in 1995, which was subsequently released through ADV Films in North America in December 1996. ADV's license of the series expired in 2007, however in November 2007, Media Blasters acquired the license to it. Media Blasters has confirmed that the dub produced by ADV was kept. In 2012, Media Blasters lost the Golden Boy license and the license was acquired by Discotek Media.
Kintaro, despite having met the requirements for a law degree, left Tokyo University without graduating. Golden Boy depicts his living the life of a free spirit, roaming Japan from town to town, job to job. During his travels, Kintaro meets several women whose lives he dramatically changes, despite poor first impressions. He constantly observes and studies the people and events around him, recording his findings in a notebook he carries on his belt.
The Golden Boy OVA has been positively received by English-language reviewers, but it is widely known for its mature content: while the OVA is not strictly a hentai animation, it does feature instances of partial female nudity, orgasms, and female masturbation. In contrast, the manga becomes almost pornographic starting in the second volume.In the 2010 19th issue of Business Jump, it was announced that a sequel to the Golden Boy manga was in the works. Tatsuya Egawa stated that the sequel involved Kintaro taking on the entertainment world for his next job.
