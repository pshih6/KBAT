Christopher John Matthews (born December 17, 1945) is a former American political commentator, retired talk show host, and author. Matthews hosted his weeknight hour-long talk show, Hardball with Chris Matthews, on America's Talking and later on MSNBC, from 1997 until March 2, 2020, when he announced (on what was his final show) that he was retiring due to an accusation that he had made inappropriate comments to a “Hardball” guest four years earlier. On his final show he stated, "The younger generation's out there ready to take the reins. We see them in politics, in media, in fighting for their causes. They're improving the workplace."
