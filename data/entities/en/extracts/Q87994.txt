Dimitré Dinev (Bulgarian: Димитър Динев) (born 1968 in Plovdiv, Bulgaria) is a Bulgarian-born Austrian writer.  He is best known for his play Kozha i nebe (Skin and sky), which controversially won the Askeer prize in 2007.Although he was born in Plovdiv, Dinev grew up and spent his childhood in the city of Pazardzhik. He attended the Bertold Brecht school of German language until his graduation in 1987. It was here that he discovered and cultivated his love of writing and German literature.
Dinev left Bulgaria in 1990 due to the poor economic situation that arose in the country after the fall of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. At this time he migrated to Austria, where he began his new life in Traiskirchen; a city just south of Vienna that served as a registration point for many immigrants to the country. In Vienna, Dinev studied philosophy and Russian language, which he financed by doing part-time work.
Since 1991, Dinev has built his career as an author, poet and screenwriter, working almost exclusively in the German language; a departure from his previous works, which had been written in his native Bulgarian.Dinev is also an outspoken advocate for immigrants and refugees in Austria. A popular theme with Dinev is the experience and plight of transnational migrants, which he expresses in his stories. These are often based on his own experience fleeing from poverty in his native land and adapting to life in a foreign country.
