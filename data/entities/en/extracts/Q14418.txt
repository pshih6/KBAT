Lake Lugano (Italian: Lago di Lugano or Ceresio, from Latin: Ceresius lacus; Lombard: Lagh de Lugan; German: Luganersee) is a glacial lake which  is situated on the border between southern Switzerland and Northern Italy. The lake, named after the city of Lugano, is situated between Lake Como and Lago Maggiore. It was cited for the first time by Gregory of Tours  in 590 with the name Ceresio, a name which is said to have derived from the Latin word cerasus, meaning cherry, and refers to the abundance of cherry trees which at one time adorned the shores of the lake. The lake appears in documents in 804 under the name Laco Luanasco.

Well-known mountains and tourist destinations on the shores of the lake are Monte Br√® to the east, Monte San Salvatore west of Lugano, and Monte Generoso on the south-east shore. The World Heritage Site Monte San Giorgio is situated south of the lake.
