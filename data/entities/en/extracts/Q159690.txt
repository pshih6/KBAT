The Piano Teacher (French: La Pianiste, lit. 'The Pianist') is a 2001 French-language erotic psychological drama film, written and directed by Michael Haneke, that is based on the 1983 novel of the same name by Elfriede Jelinek. It tells the story of an unmarried piano teacher at a Vienna conservatory, living with her mother in a state of emotional and sexual disequilibrium, who enters into a sadomasochistic relationship with her student. A co-production of Austria and France, Haneke was given the opportunity to direct after previous attempts to adapt the novel by filmmakers Valie Export and Paulus Manker collapsed for financial reasons.
At the 2001 Cannes Film Festival it won the Grand Prix, with the two leads, Isabelle Huppert and Beno√Æt Magimel, winning Best Actress and Best Actor. It went on to receive positive reviews and other awards and nominations.
