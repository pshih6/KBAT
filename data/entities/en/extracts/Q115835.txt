Hans Conrad Escher von der Linth (born 24 August 1767 in ZÃ¼rich; died 9 March 1823) was a Swiss scientist, artist, and politician. He headed the "Great Council of Switzerland" in 1798, a period of French occupation. He also published a survey of the Swiss Alps and is perhaps most significant for his work in the project to "tame" the Linth river. His son was geologist Arnold Escher von der Linth.
