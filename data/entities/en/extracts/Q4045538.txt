Nu-disco is a 21st-century dance music genre associated with a renewed interest in 1970s US disco, as well as synthesizer-heavy 1980s European dance music styles. The genre was especially popular in the mid-2000s, and experienced another small resurgence in the early to mid-2010s.
Currently there are several scenes associated with nu-disco term, the first characterized as house music fused with disco (sometimes incorrectly referred to as disco house), and disco-influenced balearic music, also known as balearic beat revival or balearica.
