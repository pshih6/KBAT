Hubert Beuve-Méry (5 January 1902 in Paris – 6 August 1989 in Fontainebleau) was a French journalist and newspaper editor. Before the Second World War, he was associated with the Vichy regime until December 1942, when he joined the Resistance. In 1944, he founded Le Monde at the behest of Charles de Gaulle. Following the liberation of France, Beuve-Méry built Le Monde from the ruins of Le Temps by using its offices, printing presses, masthead and those staff members who had not collaborated with the Germans.
