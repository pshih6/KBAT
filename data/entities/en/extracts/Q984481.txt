Charbel Nahas (Arabic: شربل نحاس‎) (born 16 August 1954) is a Lebanese politician, economist and engineer.  He is a former Lebanese Labour minister in Najib Mikati's second government. He was one of eleven Change and Reform ministers, which is headed by General Michel Aoun, the largest share that it has ever had in government. Nahas is widely considered to be a Lebanese progressive whose priority has been to improve living conditions for the country's disenfranchised poor. He submitted his resignation to Michel Aoun on 21 February 2012, and was officially resigned on 22 February 2012, arguing that all of his colleagues in government were preventing any effective improvement in workers' rights.  Nahas is currently the General Secretary of Citizens in a State, a new political party that was established in 2016 and that has as its goal to create "a civil, democratic, fair and capable state".
