École Polytechnique (also known by the nickname "X") is a French public institution of higher education and research in Palaiseau, a suburb located south of Paris. It is one of the leading prestigious French grandes écoles in engineering, especially known for its polytechnicien engineering program.
The school was established in 1794 by the mathematician Gaspard Monge during the French Revolution, and it was once previously a military academy under Napoleon I in 1804. However, Polytechnique is no longer a military academy, although the institution is still supervised by the French Ministry of Defence. Initially located in the Latin Quarter of central Paris, the establishment's main buildings were moved in 1976 to Palaiseau on the Saclay Plateau, southwest of Paris.It is a founding member of ParisTech, a grouping of Paris-area engineering colleges established in 2007. In 2014, it became a founding member of the confederal "University of Paris in Saclay". Among its alumni are three Nobel prize winners, one Fields Medalist, three Presidents of France and many CEOs of French and international companies. It is currently ranked as world's second-best small university by the Times Higher Education's World University Rankings.In the 19th century, its model inspired the foundation of similar higher education institutions, such as the École Polytechnique de Montréal and Caltech (initially a vocational school named the Throop 'Polytechnic' Institute).
