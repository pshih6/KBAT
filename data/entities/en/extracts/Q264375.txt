He was the T.Y. and Margaret Lin Professor in Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. He is currently the Professor Emeritus at the civil and environmental engineering, UC Berkeley. Wilson is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and is a recipient of the John von Neumann Award.Wilson is considered to be one of the early pioneers in the field of finite element analysis and its applications. He is credited with having written the first widely accepted computer package for structural analysis (SAP) and has co-authored the widely cited book in FEM, "Numerical Methods in Finite Element Analysis", with Klaus-Jurgen Bathe.
