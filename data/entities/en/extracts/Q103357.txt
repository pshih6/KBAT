Friedrich Erhard Niedt (31 May 1674 â€“ 1717) was a German jurist, music theorist, and composer.
Niedt was born in Jena, and enrolled at the University of Jena in 1694, where he is thought to have studied law.  Around 1700, he moved to Copenhagen, staying in Hamburg along the way.  He died in Copenhagen.
The first part of his Musical Guide might be a record of musical techniques similar to what Johann Sebastian Bach used.
