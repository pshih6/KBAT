Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus (513 BC - after 423 BC) was a Roman statesman and general who served as consul six times. Titus Quinctius was a member of the gens Quinctia, one of the oldest patrician families in Rome.
He was the son of Lucius Quinctius and grandson of Lucius Quinctius. He was possibly the brother of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus,  who was suffect consul and dictator in 460 BC, 458 BC and 439 BC.  His son, who bore the same name, Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus, was elected consul in 421 BC and was possibly the military tribune with consular power in 405 BC.
According to Livy, Titus Quinctius was still alive in 423 BC, aged 90 years.
