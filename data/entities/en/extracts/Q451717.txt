The Invisible Ray is a 1936 American science fiction horror film directed by Lambert Hillyer. The film concerns a scientist who creates a telescope-like device that captures light waves from the Andromeda Galaxy, giving him a way to view the distant past. Using this knowledge, he travels to Africa to locate a large, unusual meteorite that fell there a billion years earlier. He discovers that the meteorite is composed of a poisonous unknown element, "Radium X". After exposure to its rays begins to make him glow in the dark, his touch becomes deadly, and he begins to be slowly driven mad.
Prior to production, Universal Pictures was originally developing the film Bluebeard for Karloff and Lugosi. When that production did not start, Universal wanted a release by the end of 1935 with Karloff and Lugosi and hired director Stuart Walker and screenwriter John Colton to make the film The Invisible Ray. As Walker was not happy with Colton's script, he requested a three day delay before production was set to begin and after being denied this, he left the production and was replaced with Lambert Hillyer. Hillyer began and completed the film over-budget and over the originally set production time.
