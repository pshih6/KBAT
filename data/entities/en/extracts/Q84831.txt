Christian Gottlob Barth (31 July 1799 – 12 November 1862) was a German Protestant minister, writer and publisher. He founded the publishing house Calwer Verlag in 1833. A representative of pietism in Württemberg, he is regarded as one of the fathers of the Christian revival (Erweckungsbewegung) there in the 19th century. He is also remembered for his children's Bible, translated as "Bible Stories", and then into many languages.
