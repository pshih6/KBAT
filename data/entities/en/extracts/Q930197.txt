Nathan Glazer (February 25, 1923 â€“ January 19, 2019) was an American sociologist who taught at the University of California, Berkeley, and for several decades at Harvard University. He was a co-editor of the now-defunct policy journal The Public Interest.Known for books such as Beyond the Melting Pot, which deal with race and ethnicity, Glazer was critical of some of the Great Society programs of the mid-1960s.
He was often considered neoconservative in his thinking on domestic policy, but remained a Democrat.
He described himself as "indifferent" to the neoconservative label with which he is most associated and remarked that it was an appellation not of his choosing.
