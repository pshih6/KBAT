Molecular biology  is the branch of biology that concerns the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including molecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms and interactions.William Astbury described molecular biology in 1961 in Nature, as:

...not so much a technique as an approach, an approach from the viewpoint of the so-called basic sciences with the leading idea of searching below the large-scale manifestations of classical biology for the corresponding molecular plan. It is concerned particularly with the forms of biological molecules and [...] is predominantly three-dimensional and structural â€“ which does not mean, however, that it is merely a refinement of morphology. It must at the same time inquire into genesis and function.
