Rodven Records was a Venezuelan record label that belonged to the Cisneros family owned ODC Group, then proprietors of one of the largest TV networks in the country, Venevision. They also owned a nationwide AM radio network (RadioVision, which later expanded into the FM realm as FM Center) and a record stores chain (DiscoCenter), thus serving as a channel for those artists who belonged to the roster of either of those companies (mostly signed to Venevision).
