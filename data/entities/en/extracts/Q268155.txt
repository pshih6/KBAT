The Crimson Ghost is a 1946 12-chapter Republic film serial directed by Fred C. Brannon and William Witney with Charles Quigley and Linda Stirling playing the leads.  This was Witney's last serial, after a career that left him one of the most praised of all serial directors. The serial was re-released as a six-episode television series in the 1950s and as a television film called Cyclotrode "X" in 1966. In the 1990s The Crimson Ghost was one of only two Republic serials to be colorized.  The villain of the serial, the Crimson Ghost of the title, is one of the most visually striking of the medium.  The horror punk band Misfits adapted his visage as their skull logo, and he has appeared in the music video for the song "The Number of the Beast" by Iron Maiden.
