Peter London (born Peter Lundén; 28 September 1982 in Sweden) is a Swedish bassist. He is best known as the bassist for the Swedish sleaze band Crashdïet, but he also performs as a one-man band, Alter Egon. He is sponsored by Daisy Rock Guitars and is commonly seen with a glittery pink model.  As Alter Egon, London plays all the instruments himself and sings in Swedish. The songs are mostly about himself and sexual freedom. Since 2015, London has been the bass-player of RAC/pop rock-band Bedårande Barn where Jimmie Åkesson plays keyboard.
London married Swedish model and former Miss Sweden title-holder Isabel Lestapier Winqvist on 25 June 2010 at the Hedvig Eleonora Church in Stockholm. They were divorced in March 2012.
