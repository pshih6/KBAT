The Left Party (Swedish: Vänsterpartiet, V) is a socialist  political party in Sweden. The party originated as a split from the Swedish Social Democratic Party in 1917, as the Swedish Social Democratic Left Party (Sveriges socialdemokratiska vänsterparti, SSV), and became the Communist Party of Sweden in 1921. In 1967, the party was renamed Left Party - the Communists; it adopted its current name in 1990. The party has never been part of a government at the national level.
On economic issues, the party opposes privatizations and advocates increased public expenditure. The Left Party was against accession to the European Union, and supported a Swedish exit from the EU until February 2019. It attempted to get Sweden to join the Non-Aligned Movement in 1980, but did not succeed. The party supports feminism.From 1998 to 2006, the Left Party was in a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the ruling Social Democrats and the Green Party. Since 2014, it has supported the minority government of Social Democrats and Greens in the Swedish parliament, as well as in many of Sweden's counties and municipalities.
The Left Party is a member of the Nordic Green Left Alliance, and its sole MEP sits in the European United Left–Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) group. In 2018, the party joined Maintenant le Peuple.
