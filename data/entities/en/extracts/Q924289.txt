King's College is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England.  Formally The King's College of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas in Cambridge, the college lies beside the River Cam and faces out onto King's Parade in the centre of the city.
King's was founded in 1441 by Henry VI, soon after he had founded its sister college in Eton.  However, the King's plans for the college were disrupted by the Wars of the Roses and the resultant scarcity of funds, and by his eventual deposition. Little progress was made on the project until in 1508 Henry VII began to take an interest in the college, most likely as a political move to legitimise his new position.  The building of the college's chapel, begun in 1446, was finally finished in 1544 during the reign of Henry VIII.
King's College Chapel is regarded as one of the greatest examples of late Gothic English architecture.  It has the world's largest fan vault, and the chapel's stained-glass windows and wooden chancel screen are considered some of the finest from their era.  The building is seen as emblematic of Cambridge. The chapel's choir, composed of male students at King's and choristers from the nearby King's College School, is one of the most accomplished and renowned in the world.  Every year on Christmas Eve the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols (a service originally devised for Truro Cathedral by the college dean Eric Milner-White) is broadcast from the chapel to millions of listeners worldwide.
