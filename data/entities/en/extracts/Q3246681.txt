The École supérieure de journalisme (ESJ Paris; in English: Superior School of Journalism of Paris) is an institution of higher education in Paris dedicated to journalism and related studies. Its origin was in the Collège Libre des Sciences Sociales founded in 1895 by Dick May (pen name of Jeanne Weill, daughter of the rabbi of Algiers), and other supporters during the Dreyfus Affair. It was made a separate Grande Ecole in 1899 and claims the title of the "world's first school of journalism". Intended to give students a broad knowledge of politics and economics, it did not award a separate journalism degree by name until 1910.
The University of Missouri School of Journalism also claims the title of "first in the world", but it did not open until 1908 in Columbia, Missouri in the United States.
