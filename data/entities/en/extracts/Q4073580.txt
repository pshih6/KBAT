Vladimir Lvovich Ashurkov (Russian: Владимир Львович Ашурков, born 15 February 1972) is a Russian political figure and the Executive Director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation. A former banker, Ashurkov was the Director of Group Portfolio Management and Control at Alfa Group Consortium from 2006 to 2012, when he was asked to step down due to his political involvement with Alexei Navalny. He was also on the board of the X5 Retail Group during this time.
In 2014, Russia's Investigative Committee charged Ashurkov with embezzlement of funds from Alexei Navalny's 2013 mayoral campaign, after which he applied for political asylum in Great Britain, claiming the charges were politically motivated. Both Ashurkov and Navalny maintain that the charges were baseless.
