Naomi R. Wolf (born November 12, 1962) is an American liberal progressive feminist author, journalist, and former political advisor to Al Gore and Bill Clinton.
Via Wolf's first book The Beauty Myth (1991), she became a leading spokeswoman of what has been described as the third wave of the feminist movement. Such leading feminists as Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan praised the work; others, including Camille Paglia and Christina Hoff Sommers, criticized it. Her later books include the bestseller The End of America in 2007 and Vagina: A New Biography. Critics have challenged the quality and veracity of the scholarship in her books, including Outrages (2019). In this case, her serious misreading of court records led to its publication in the U.S. being cancelled.Her career in journalism began in 1995 and has included topics such as abortion, the Occupy Wall Street movement, Edward Snowden and ISIS. She has written for media outlets such as The Nation, The New Republic, The Guardian and The Huffington Post.
