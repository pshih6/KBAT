Castro is widely known as one of the main drivers for the fight for acceptance of the LGBT+ community, especially in Latin American countries - most notably, Cuba - as well as dissolving some of the antiquated stigmas and stereotypes that surround the community. She is the daughter of Communist Party First Secretary Raúl Castro and feminist and revolutionary Vilma Espín, and the niece of former First Secretary Fidel Castro.
