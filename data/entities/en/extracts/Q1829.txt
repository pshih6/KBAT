Kaliningrad (Russian: Калининград, IPA: [kəlʲɪnʲɪnˈɡrat], historically German: Königsberg, Polish: Królewiec, Lithuanian: Karaliaučius) is the largest city and the administrative centre of Kaliningrad Oblast, a Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea. At the 2010 Census, Kaliningrad's population was 431,902.Situated between Poland and Lithuania, both now in the European Union, Kaliningrad was strategically of importance during the Cold War. Following the de facto annexation of the territory, Soviet authorities built a new city that erased most historic links to the old city. In some districts, a few pre-war monuments remain.
