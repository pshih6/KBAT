Altered is a 2006 American science fiction horror film directed by Eduardo Sánchez and written by Jamie Nash. It was Sánchez's first solo effort as director following his co-directing of The Blair Witch Project in 1999.
The plot is an inversion of the standard alien abduction formula, as four men abduct a lone alien, planning to wreak revenge on the invading species. In its early stages, the film was entitled Probed, and was intended as a comic homage to work of Sam Raimi and Troma Entertainment.
