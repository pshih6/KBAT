He Loves Me... He Loves Me Not (French: À la folie... pas du tout) is a 2002 French psychological drama film directed by Lætitia Colombani. The film focuses on a Fine Arts student, played by Audrey Tautou, and a married cardiologist, played by Samuel Le Bihan, with whom she is dangerously obsessed. The film studies the condition of erotomania and is both an example of the nonlinear and "unreliable narrator" forms of storytelling.
The title refers to the last two lines of the French game of Effeuiller la Marguerite (Fr., "to pluck the daisy") of pulling petals off a flower, in which one seeks to determine whether the object of their affection returns that affection and to what extent: un peu ("a little"), beaucoup ("a lot"); passionnément ("passionately"): à la folie ("to madness"); pas du tout ("not at all").
