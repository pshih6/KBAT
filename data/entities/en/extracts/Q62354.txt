Jean-François Copé (French: [ʒɑ̃.fʁɑ̃.swa kɔ.pe]; born 5 May 1964) is a French politician. He is Mayor of Meaux. He was Spokesperson for the French Government between 2002 and 2007, and assumed other tenures in the government—including Minister of the Budget—at the same time. He was also Deputy (Député) for the 6th constituency of Seine-et-Marne, and President of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) Group in the French National Assembly. In November 2010 he became General Secretary of the UMP. In August 2012 he announced that he would run for the presidency of the UMP, facing the former Prime Minister François Fillon.
On 19 November 2012 he was elected President of the UMP with 50.03% of votes from its members, defeating François Fillon, who asserted his own victory. He resigned from the post on 27 May 2014 following an invoices scandal and poor results for the UMP at the 2014 European elections.
