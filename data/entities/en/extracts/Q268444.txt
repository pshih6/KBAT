Has Anybody Seen My Gal? is a 1952 comedy film distributed by Universal-International, directed by Douglas Sirk, and stars Piper Laurie, Rock Hudson, Charles Coburn, and Gigi Perreau. Set in the 1920s, the film leans heavily on period detail, such as flappers, the Charleston and raccoon coats. It is named for the jazz song Has Anybody Seen My Gal? which was a hit for The California Ramblers during the '20s. Though the song is sung during the movie, its lyrics have no particular relation to the plot.
