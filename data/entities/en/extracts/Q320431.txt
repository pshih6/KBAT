Scorched is a 2003 independent criminal comedy film directed by Gavin Grazer, starring Alicia Silverstone, Rachael Leigh Cook, Woody Harrelson and John Cleese. Scorched follows the story of several disgruntled bank employees who all try to rob the same bank on the same night without knowing that others are doing exactly the same thing.
The film had a very poor financial performance at the box office. From the initial budget of US $7 million, Scorched earned back only $8,000 at the end of its theatrical run. It was pulled from its theatrical run after just one weekend in the theaters where it managed to earn a meager $666 per theater.
