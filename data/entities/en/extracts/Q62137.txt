Franz Xaver Gabelsberger (9 February 1789 – 4 January 1849, both in Munich) was a German inventor of a shorthand writing system, named Gabelsberger shorthand after him.

Gabelsberger, employed as typist by the Bavarian government, started to develop a new shorthand system at age of 28. His system was first fully described in the textbook Anleitung zur deutschen Redezeichenkunst oder Stenographie (1834) and became rapidly used. He is buried in the Alter Südfriedhof in Munich.
