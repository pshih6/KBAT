Mortal Thoughts is a 1991 American neo-noir film directed by Alan Rudolph and starring Demi Moore, Glenne Headly, Bruce Willis, and Harvey Keitel. Told in narrative flashbacks set in a police interrogation, the film centers on a woman implicated in the violent murder of her friend's abusive, drug-addicted husband. Its title is derived from a quote in William Shakespeare's The Tragedy of Macbeth.
