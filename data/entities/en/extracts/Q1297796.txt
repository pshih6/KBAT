The N. G. Kuznetsov Naval Academy (Russian: Военно-морская академия имени Н. Г. Кузнецова) is the main staff college and postgraduate institution for the Russian Navy and is located in Saint Petersburg.
In 1827 Admiral Ivan Kruzenshtern initiated an Officers' Class at the Naval Cadet Corps. In 1862 the Class was reorganized into an Academic Course of Maritime Science. In 1877, to mark its fiftieth anniversary, the Class was renamed the Nikolaev Naval Academy (Nikolayevskaya Morskaya Akademiya) and in 1910 was completely detached from the Naval Cadet Corps. The Academy's last pre-revolutionary class was in 1913.
Toward the end of the Soviet era the Academy was named the A. A. Grechko Naval Academy and finally was renamed the N. G. Kuznetsov Naval Academy. It is a postgraduate institution somewhat comparable to the U.S. Naval War College and should not be confused with officer commissioning schools such as the U.S. Naval Academy.
