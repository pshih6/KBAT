Gheorghe Zamfir (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈɡe̯orɡe zamˈfir] (listen); born April 6, 1941) is a Romanian  nai (pan flute) musician.
Zamfir is known for playing an expanded version of normally 20-pipe nai, with 22, 25, 28 or even 30 pipes, to increase its range, and obtaining as many as eight overtones (additional to the fundamental tone) from each pipe by changing his embouchure. He is known as "The Master of the Pan Flute".
