Tom and Jerry Tales is a Canadian-American animated television series starring the seven-time Academy Award-winning cat-and-mouse duo Tom and Jerry. Produced by Warner Bros. Animation and Turner Entertainment Co., It is the seventh incarnation of the Tom and Jerry franchise as well as the first Tom and Jerry television series to emulate the original theatrical shorts created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; it originally ran in the United States from September 23, 2006 to March 22, 2008 on Kids' WB.
Joseph Barbera served as executive producer for the series before his death on December 18, 2006, and received story credit on some episodes of the first season. The series consists of two seasons and 26 episodes, each consisting of three stories (some of them—like The Karate Guard—were produced and completed in 2003 as part of a 30-plus theatrical cartoon schedule aborted after the financial fiasco of Looney Tunes: Back in Action) with approximately the same running time as the original theatrical shorts and focusing on a shared theme between them.
