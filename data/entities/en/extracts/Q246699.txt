Lars "Lasse" Johansson (1638 – August 13, 1674), usually referred to under his pseudonym Lucidor (pronounced [ˈlʉ̌ːsɪdɔr]), was a Swedish baroque poet. He is remembered for his burlesque poetry that is seen as foreshadowing that of Johan Runius and, especially, Carl Michael Bellman, and for his dramatic death in a tumultuous brawl at the Fimmelstången tavern in Gamla stan in Stockholm. Lasse Johansson wrote under several different pseudonyms, but of these Lucidor (or Lucidor den olycklige, "Lucidor the Unfortunate", as he called himself on occasion) is the one under which he is commonly known today.
