He is currently professor of computer science at Paris-Sud 11 University since 1992 (in the in Situ group) and was director of LRI, the laboratory for computer science, from 2002 to 2009.
He has worked in Human-Computer Interaction for over 20 years and was elected to the ACM SIGCHI Academy in 2006. His research interests include fundamental aspects of interaction, engineering of interactive systems, computer-supported cooperative work and novel interaction techniques. In 2004, his paper "Designing interaction, not interfaces" has been one of the most heavily downloaded papers in the ACM Digital Library. He has been featured in Ben Shneiderman's HCI Pioneers.Michel Beaudouin-Lafon was one of the founders, and first president, of AFIHM, the French national equivalent of Association for Computing Machinery SIGCHI.
