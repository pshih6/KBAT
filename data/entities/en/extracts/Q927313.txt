Denis Robert (born 9 May 1958) is a French investigative journalist, novelist and filmmaker.  He formerly worked for 12 years for the newspaper Libération.  In 2008, he was involved in a polemic with Philippe Val, former director of the magazine Charlie Hebdo, and journalist Edwy Plenel.
Robert's books, films and press interviews, denouncing the opaque workings of the Clearstream clearing house, got him into more than 60 lawsuits in France, Belgium and Luxembourg by banks, such as Menatep (a Russian bank) and BGL (BNP Paribas Fortis), as well as the Clearstream company.
On 3 February 2011, after ten years of litigation, Robert was cleared by the Court of Cassation of his conviction for both of his books Révélation$ and La Boite Noire (The Black Box), and also for his documentary film Les Dissimulateurs.Robert is also a painter, whose work is displayed in Paris art galleries (La Bank, W).
