Wei Wei (Chinese: 魏巍; pinyin: Wèi Wéi; January 16, 1920 – August 24, 2008), originally known as Hong Jie (simplified Chinese: 鸿杰; traditional Chinese: 鴻傑; pinyin: Hóng Jié), was a poet, a prose writer, a literary report writer, a journalist, a vice-editor-in-chief and the editor of various newspapers in China and a propagandist. His works are noted for their themes of patriotism, communism, and nationalism. Apart from using the name Wei Wei, he once used the pen name Hong Yangshu  (紅陽樹) in some of his publications. He changed his name from Hong Jie to Wei Wei in 1937 when he had started a new page of his life, a political one.
