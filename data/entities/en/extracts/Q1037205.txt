Carl Robert Butler, known professionally as Carl Butler, (June 2, 1927 – September 4, 1992) was an American country music singer-songwriter and one half of the husband-and-wife duo Carl and Pearl Butler. Carl and Pearl Butler had one of the biggest-selling singles of 1962, "Don't Let Me Cross Over". A later single, "Too Late to Try Again", hit No. 9 on the country charts in 1964 for them, while the B side, "My Tears Don't Show", crept up to No. 36. Butler wrote those 2 songs and also "If Tear Drops Were Pennies" (twice a top ten country hit – Carl Smith in 1951 and Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner in 1973 – and also a minor hit (#21) on the pop charts for Rosemary Clooney in 1951) and "Crying My Heart Out Over You" (written with Lester Flatt, Earl Scruggs, and Earl Sherry, the song charted for Flatt and Scruggs in 1960, but is best known from the 1982 Ricky Scaggs version, which hit #1).
