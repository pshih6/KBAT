Pope Innocent IV (Latin: Innocentius IV; c. 1195 â€“ 7 December 1254), born Sinibaldo Fieschi, was the head of the Catholic Church from 25 June 1243 to his death in 1254.Fieschi was born in Genoa and studied at the universities of Parma and Bologna. Considered a fine canonist, he served in the Curia for Pope Honorius III. Pope Gregory IX made Fieschi a cardinal and appointed him governor of the March of Ancona in 1235. He was elected pope in 1243 and took the name Innocent IV. He inherited an ongoing dispute over lands seized by the Holy Roman Emperor, and the following year relocated to France to escape imperial plots against him in Rome. He returned to Rome after the death of the Emperor in 1250.
