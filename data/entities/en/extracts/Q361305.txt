Claude Chappe (25 December 1763 â€“ 23 January 1805) was a French inventor who in 1792 demonstrated a practical semaphore system that eventually spanned all of France.  His system consisted of a series of towers, each within line of sight of others, each supporting a wooden mast with two crossarms on pivots that could be placed in various positions.  The operator in a tower moved the arms to a sequence of positions, spelling out text messages in semaphore code.  The operator in the next tower read the message through a telescope, then passed it on to the next tower.  This was the first practical telecommunications system of the industrial age, and was used until the 1850s when electric telegraph systems replaced it.
