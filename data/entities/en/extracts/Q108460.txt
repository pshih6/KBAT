Wolfgang Steinitz (28 February 1905 â€“ 21 April 1967) was a German linguist and folklorist.  
Through his rediscovery of hidden social commentary in traditional folk songs, he was an important pioneer of the German folk-revival in both East and West Germany. 
He researched the language and culture of the Ugric people of West Siberia, including the songs that form an important part of the tradition of this endangered ethnic group. 
Steinitz also left extensive work in other areas of linguistic studies.
