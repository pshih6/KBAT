Fast & Furious (alternatively known as Fast & Furious 4) is a 2009 action adventure film directed by Justin Lin and written by Chris Morgan. The fourth installment in the Fast & Furious franchise, it is a direct sequel to The Fast and the Furious (2001), and stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, John Ortiz and Laz Alonso. Fast & Furious follows Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent Brian O'Conner (Walker) and Dominic Toretto (Diesel) who are forced to work together to avenge the murder of Toretto's lover Letty Ortiz (Rodriguez) and apprehend drug lord Arturo Braga (Ortiz).
Fast & Furious marked the first film in the series since the original installment, The Fast and the Furious, to feature the main cast. As a result, this spawned a shift within the series' chronological order, with developers setting Fast & Furious between the second and third installments, to account for their absences. Casting began in July 2007, after Universal Studios confirmed the returns of Walker and Diesel, while principal photography began in Los Angeles in February 2008, with the film being shot in California.Fast & Furious was released in the United States on April 3, 2009. The film set box office records for its opening-weekend and spring opening-weekend gross. It quickly became the highest-grossing film in the franchise and eventually grossed over $363 million worldwide. The film was also the 17th-highest-grossing film of 2009.
Despite its commercial success, Fast & Furious received mixed reviews, with some critics singling out the performances of Diesel and Walker, and the film's soundtrack, but criticising the storyline and dialogue. A sequel, Fast Five, was released in April 2011 to box office success, surpassing Fast & Furious as the highest-grossing film in the franchise.
