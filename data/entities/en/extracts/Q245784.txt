Bojan Pečar (Serbian Cyrillic: Бојан Печар) (22 March 1960, Belgrade – 13 October 1998, London) was a Yugoslav and Serbian musician, best known as bass player of the cult Yugoslav rock band Ekatarina Velika. Previously he was a member of the new wave group VIA Talas, who were featured on the Yugoslav new wave compilation album Artistička radna akcija. He died on 13 October 1998 in London, England, officially of a heart attack, and was buried in Progar, outside Belgrade, Serbia. He is the one of many from the former Yugoslavia (like Vladimir Cvitan and Hrvoje Horvatic) who died at young age in London, but the cause of those deaths remains a mystery.
