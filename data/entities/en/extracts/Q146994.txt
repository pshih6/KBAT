Zanobi da Strada (1312 in Strada in Chianti â€“ 1361 in Avignon), was an Italian translator, scholar and correspondent of Petrarch and a friend of Giovanni Boccaccio.He was responsible for some manuscript rediscoveries in the Monte Cassino monastery library to which he had access as secretary to the diocesan bishop and where he lived from 1355 to 1357. Early Apuleius MS marginalia (incl. mysterious spurcum additamentum at Met. 10.21.1) is in his hand.Zanobi da Strada was crowned poet laureate by Charles IV on May 15 1355 at Pisa to the great disgust of Boccaccio who declined to recognise the degree as legitimate.
