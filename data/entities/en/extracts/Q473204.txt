Annoying Orange is an American comedy web series created by former Minnesota film student and MTV production assistant Dane Boedigheimer in 2009. It stars its creator as an anthropomorphic orange who annoys fruits, vegetables, and various other objects by using jokes and puns, which are sometimes crude.
The show became popular, later leading to its becoming the subject of a TV series, a video game, a range of toys, backpacks, couches, pillows, blankets, lunchboxes, drink bottles, mattresses, towels, and a T-shirt line. Other accessories, such as costumes of the series' characters, have also appeared on the market for the company.
Since its inception, the Annoying Orange YouTube channel has amassed over 9 million subscribers.
