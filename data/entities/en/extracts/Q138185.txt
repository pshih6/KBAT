Paul Myners, Baron Myners, CBE (born 1 April 1948) is a British businessman and politician. He was the Financial Services Secretary (sometimes referred to as City Minister) in HM Treasury, the UK's finance ministry, during the Labour Government of Gordon Brown. He held the position from October 2008 until May 2010, and was made a life peer in consequence of his appointment, as he was not an elected Member of Parliament. He also served on the Prime Minister's National Economic Council. He now sits as a crossbencher in the House of Lords.
Myners has worked in the financial sector since 1974. He has also held a number of third sector posts, including chairman of the trustees of the Tate and chairman of the Low Pay Commission. Immediately prior to his ministerial appointment he was chairman of the Guardian Media Group, publisher of The Guardian and The Observer newspapers, and chairman of Land Securities, the largest quoted property company in Europe at that time. He is a former chairman of Marks & Spencer and deputy chairman of PowerGen.
