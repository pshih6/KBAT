Marcelino Olaechea (Marcelino Olaechea Loizaga) (9 January 1889, Baracaldo, Biscay - 21 October 1972, Valencia) was a Spanish Catholic religious, S.D.B, and Bishop of Pamplona during the Spanish Civil War.
His father worked in the iron and steel industry and so on Olaechea's episcopal coat of arms, instead of lions rampant or eagles with two heads, a chimney of the Altos Hornos iron foundry at Bilbao appeared. He joined the Salesian Society of St John Bosco, and attained a high administrative position in that congregation, until 25 August 1935, when he was appointed Bishop of Pamplona. His episcopal consecration, at the hands of Federico Tedeschini, the Papal Nuncio, was celebrated in Madrid on 27 October. He was the first Salesian bishop of Spain.
On 18 February 1946 he was translated to the Archbishop's see of Valencia and he died there on 21 October 1972.
