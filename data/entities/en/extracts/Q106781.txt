In film, his collaborations with Michael Glawogger, Oliver Hirschbiegel, Peter Popzlatev, Sönke Wortmann, and Til Schweiger have extended his popularity to a wider audience. He also played the title role in the crime series Flemming. Besides his theater engagements at all of the important German language theaters, Samuel Finzi has performed in many film and television productions.

Finz shapes his figures as smart, associative character studies, which bear witness to a detailed and intelligent acting strategy. Audiences and the press celebrate his intensive images of human motivation that are almost craving for transformation and his effortless precision when performing.
