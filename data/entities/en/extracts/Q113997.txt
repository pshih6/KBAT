Kurt Kasznar (born Kurt Servischer; August 12, 1913 â€“ August 6, 1979) was an Austrian-American stage, film, and television actor who played roles on Broadway, appearing in the original productions of Waiting for Godot, The Sound of Music and Barefoot in the Park, and had many notable parts in television and feature films.
"A big, glib, dapper man who spoke with an accent, he was almost always cast as some sort of a Continental gentleman," reported The New York Times.
As a soldier in World War II, Kasznar was among the first U.S. Army photographers to film the ruins of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
