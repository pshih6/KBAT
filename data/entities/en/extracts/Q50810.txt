Johann Justus Georg Gustav von Rauch (1 April 1774, in Braunschweig – 2 April 1841, in Berlin) was a Prussian general of the infantry and Minister of War from 1837 to 1841. As a close collaborator of General Gerhard von Scharnhorst, he belonged to the circle of Prussian army reformers. He was associated with the reform of the military education system, the further development of the Prussian fortifications and the reorganization of the engineering and pioneering systems. Rauch furthered the development of the Prussian Navy and had the first medical companies set up in the Prussian army. He was chief of staff from 1812–1813 and Inspector General of all fortresses and Chief of the Corps of Engineers from 1814–1837. He became the 16th honorary citizen of Berlin. His daughter Rosalie Gräfin von Hohenau, née von Rauch, married Prince Albert of Prussia as second, morganatic, wife in 1850.
