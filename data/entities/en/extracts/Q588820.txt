Cocteau Twins were a Scottish rock band active from 1979 to 1997. They were formed in Grangemouth by Robin Guthrie (guitars, drum machine) and Will Heggie (bass), adding Elizabeth Fraser (vocals) in 1981 and replacing Heggie with multi-instrumentalist Simon Raymonde in 1983. The group has earned critical praise for their distinctive ethereal sound and the soprano vocals of Fraser, whose lyrics often abandon recognisable language. They have been recognised as pioneering the 1980s alternative rock subgenre of dream pop.After signing with the British record label 4AD in 1982, the band released their debut album Garlands later that year. The addition of Raymonde in 1983 solidified their final lineup, which produced The Spangle Maker EP (containing their biggest hit in their native United Kingdom, "Pearly-Dewdrops' Drops", peaking at No. 29 on the UK Singles Chart) and their third studio album Treasure in 1984.
Raymonde temporarily left the band during the recording of their fourth album, Victorialand. In 1988, Cocteau Twins signed with Capitol Records in the United States, distributing their fifth album Blue Bell Knoll through a major label in the country. Following the release of Heaven or Las Vegas in 1990, their most critically acclaimed album, the band left 4AD for Fontana Records, where they would release their final two albums.
Due to the disintegration of Fraser and Guthrie's romantic relationship, Cocteau Twins split up in 1997. In 2005, the band announced that they would reunite to headline Coachella and embark on a world tour; a month later, the reunion was cancelled after Fraser declared her refusal to perform on stage with her ex-boyfriend Guthrie.
