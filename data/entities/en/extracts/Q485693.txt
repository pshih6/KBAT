Anand Jon Alexander (born November 28, 1976), also known as Anand Jon is an Indian-born American celebrity fashion designer who appeared on America's Next Top Model and was listed in Newsweek's ”Who’s Next in 2007?”. In November 2008, Anand Jon was convicted at the Los Angeles court Court on one count of rape and multiple counts of lesser sexual offenses. He was sentenced to 59 years to life. Anand Jon was facing similar charges in New York, but before the trial began in 2013, the New York prosecutors had independently dismissed almost all the charges in their case which featured almost the same witnesses and charges as the overlapping Los Angeles case. Anand Jon subsequently accepted a "time served" plea for one of the initial 49 counts in exchange for New York prosecutors turning over materials he has since proceeded to use in a Writ of Habeas Corpus seeking relief from his California convictions.
