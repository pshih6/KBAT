Paul Kevin Jonas II (born November 5, 1987) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, actor, contractor, dancer, and entrepreneur. He rose to fame as a member of the pop rock band, Jonas Brothers, alongside his younger brothers Joe and Nick.

After signing with Hollywood Records, the group released their self-titled second studio album in 2007, which became their breakthrough record.
