Kropyvnytskyi (Ukrainian: Кропивни́цький, romanized: Kropyvnyc'kyj [kropɪu̯ˈnɪtsʲkɪj] (listen); Russian: Кропивницкий, romanized: Kropivnitskiy), a city in central Ukraine on the Inhul river, functions as the administrative center of the Kirovohrad Oblast. Population: 232 052 (2015 est.).
Over its history, Kropyvnytskyi has changed its name several times. The settlement was known as Yelisavetgrad (Ukrainian: Єлисаветгра́д [jɛlʲisavʲɛtɣrad]) after Empress Elizabeth of Russia (r. 1741–1761) from 1752 to 1924, was renamed Zinovyevsk (Ukrainian: Зінов'э́вськ, [zʲinɔvɛ́vsʲk]) after Bolshevik revolutionary and Politburo member Grigory Zinoviev in 1924, who was born there in 1883. Following the assassination of the First Secretary of the Leningrad City Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Sergei Kirov (in office 1926–1934), the town was renamed Kirovo (Ukrainian: КІ́рово [kʲírɔvɔ]) in Kirov's honour on 7 December 1934, as did numerous other localities throughout the USSR (including present-day Kirov in Kirov Oblast, Kirovakan, Kirovabad, as well as an uncountable number of Kirovsk, Kirovo, Kirovsky and other derivatives). Concurrently to the creation of the Kirovohrad Oblast on 10 January 1939, and to distinguish it from the Kirov Oblast in central Russia, Kirovo was renamed Kirovohrad (Ukrainian: Кіровогра́д [kirowoˈɦrɑd]; Russian: Кировогра́д, romanized: Kirovograd), a name it maintained until 2016. Due to decommunization the name of the city was changed to Kropyvnytskyi, after writer, actor and playwright Marko Kropyvnytskyi, who was born near the city. However the Kirovohrad Oblast was not renamed because as it is mentioned in the Constitution of Ukraine, and the Oblast can only be renamed by a constitutional amendment.The city is the birthplace of noted figures such as Grigory Zinoviev, Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Arseny Tarkovsky, African Spir, Marko Kropyvnytskyi and others.
