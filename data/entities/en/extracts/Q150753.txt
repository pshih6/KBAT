Fireworks (German: Feuerwerk) is a 1954 West German musical comedy film directed by Kurt Hoffmann and starring Lilli Palmer, Karl Schönböck and Romy Schneider. Palmer's rendition of the song "O mein Papa" became a major hit. It was Palmer's debut film in her native Germany, having spent many years in exile in Britain, and launched her career as a major star in the country.
The film is based on the 1950 stage musical Das Feuerwerk partly written by Erik Charell. It was made at the Bavaria Studios in Munich and on location in Switzerland. The film's sets were designed by the art director Werner Schlichting.
It is a circus film set at the beginning of the twentieth century.
