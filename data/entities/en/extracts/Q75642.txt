Not to be confused with Johannes Sturm (1507-1589), German-French educatorJohann Christoph Sturm (3 November 1635 â€“ 26 December 1703) was a German philosopher.
Sturm is the author of Physica Electiva (1697), a book that criticized Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and prompted him to publish a rebuke. Sturm's critique was aimed at Leibniz's view that Nature and/or its constituent parts possess some creative force of their own. This criticism was partly theological, in that Sturm claimed Leibniz's view of Nature undermined the sovereignty of the Christian God.
