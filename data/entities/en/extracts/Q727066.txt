Jet Airways (India) Ltd. is a bankrupt and grounded Indian international airline based in Mumbai, India which, on 17 April 2019, ceased all flight operations with its last revenue flight operated by a Jet Konnect Boeing 737 arriving into Mumbai on 17 April 2019. From the third quarter of 2010 onward, Jet Airways was the largest commercial passenger airline in India with a passenger market share of 22.6%. With its competitors, mainly SpiceJet and IndiGo, lowering ticket fares in the following years, it was forced to follow suit, hurting overall performance resulting in steep financial losses. It dropped to second place behind IndiGo in October 2017, with a passenger market share of 17.8%. The downward slide continued and resulted in bankruptcy.
