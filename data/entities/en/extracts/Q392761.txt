Agent Red is a 2000 American action film directed by Damian Lee and Jim Wynorski and starring Dolph Lundgren. Its plot concerns two soldiers stuck on a submarine with a group of terrorists who plan to use a chemical weapon on America.
After the film was completed, producer Andrew Stevens deemed it too inept to be released. Screenwriter Steve Latshaw was brought in to make the film at least half-competent, while Wynorski was hired to direct some new scenes (about 40 minutes of footage in three days) and insert stock footage (mostly from Fred Olen Ray's Counter Measures with Michael Dudikoff from which it became a remake of) where appropriate.
