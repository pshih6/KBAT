Larry Kaplan is an American video game designer and programmer best known for the 1981 Atari 2600 game, Kaboom!. and for helping to found Activision.
Kaplan studied at the University of California, Berkeley from 1968 through 1974 and graduated with a degree in Computer Science. He started at Atari, Inc. in August 1976 and wrote games for the Atari Video Computer System. Due to the lack of recognition for his work he joined Activision in late 1979. Since leaving Activision in 1982, Kaplan has worked at Amiga, Atari Games, Silicon Graphics, Worlds of Wonder, and MicroUnity.
He was hired as Lead Technical Director on the 1998 movie Antz, but stayed with the project for only a few months.
