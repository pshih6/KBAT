Charles-Joseph Mathon de la Cour (6 October 1738, Lyon – 15 November 1793, Lyon) was a French art critic, mathematician, financier, and essayist. He was the son of the mathematician Jacques Mathon de la Cour (1712–1777).
He wrote distinguished works such as L'État des finances de la France ("The state of French finances", 1758), the Lettres sur les peintures, sculptures et gravures exposées au salon du Louvre ("Letters discussing the paintings, sculptures and engravings exhibited at the Louvre", Paris, 1763–1767, 3 vol. duodecimo), L'Opéra d'Orphée et d'Eurydice ("The opera Orphée et Eurydice", 1765) as well as Dissertations and Discours such as Discours sur les meilleurs moyens de faire naître et d'encourager la patriotisme dans une monarchie ("Essay on the best methods of kindling and fostering patriotism in a monarchy", Paris: Cuchet et Gatty, 1788, octavo), etc. He took an interest in charitable works and created the Société Philanthropique de Lyon.
In the 1760s he considered starting a music journal called Le Rossignol, but instead helped Sautreau de Marsy with his Almanach des Muses ("Almanac of the Muses"), and in 1773 briefly edited Nicolas Framery's Journal de musique. He founded the Journal de Lyon in 1784 (12 vol. octavo).
Mathon de la Cour's generosity and distinction could not protect him during the Revolution; after the siege of Lyon he was guillotined.
