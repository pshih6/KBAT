He graduated from Morningside College, Sioux City, Iowa, in 1915. He taught school at Alta, Iowa, and Humboldt, Iowa, until 1918, when he enlisted in the U.S. Army and was enrolled in signal officers' training school at New Haven, where he was when the First World War ended.Following the conclusion of his military service, he attended the University of Chicago Law School where he became a member of the Delta Chi fraternity, graduating in 1921. He was admitted to the bar the same year and commenced private practice in Chicago.

In the primary election, Dolliver finished a distant third.Two years later, Dolliver ran for the U.S. House for a seat held by Fred C. Gilchrist, an incumbent member of Dolliver's own party who was then completing his seventh term in office. In a primary characterized by light turnout, Dolliver defeated Gilchrist in a close race. He then ran against Charles Hanna in the general election, defeating him handily.  Dolliver was re-elected five times before losing in 1956 to Democrat Merwin Coad, in an extraordinarily close race. Coad won by 198 votes, out of over 129,000 cast. In all, Dolliver served from January 3, 1945 to January 3, 1957.
