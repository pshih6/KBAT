NGT48 (read "N.G.T. Forty-eight") is a Japanese idol girl group produced by Yasushi Akimoto. NGT48 is named after Niigata City of Niigata Prefecture, where the group is based. The group performs at the NGT48 Theater which is located in the fourth floor of the LoveLa2 shopping mall in Niigata City.Since 2019, NGT48 has been under scrutiny and criticism surrounding then-member Maho Yamaguchi's assault in December 2018, after which she had claimed that the management had done nothing to address other NGT48 members allegedly involved in assisting her attackers. In April 2019, the NGT48 management dissolved the team system, with all current members unified according to generations.
