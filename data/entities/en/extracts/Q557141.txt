The term public art refers to a specific art genre with its own professional and critical discourse. It represents art in any media whose form, function and meaning are created for the general public through a public process.  Public art is visually and physically accessible to the public - it is installed or staged in public space or the public realm, usually outside.  Public art embodies public or universal concepts rather than commercial, partisan or personal concepts or interests, and it has clear aesthetic qualities in form or theme.  Notably, public art is also the direct or indirect product of a public process of creation, procurement, and/or maintenance.Independent art created or staged in or near the public realm (for example, graffiti, street art, yard art/lawn ornaments) lacks official or tangible public sanction and is not within the public art genre.  Such unofficial artwork may exist on private property immediately adjacent to the public realm, on public property or in natural settings but, however ubiquitous, it falls outside the definition of public art by its absence of public process or public sanction as bona fide public art.
