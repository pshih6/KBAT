Speed Racer is a 2008 sports action comedy film written, co-produced and directed by the Wachowskis and based on the 1960s anime and manga series of the same name. Starring Emile Hirsch, Christina Ricci, John Goodman, Susan Sarandon, Matthew Fox, Roger Allam, Benno FÃ¼rmann, Hiroyuki Sanada, Rain and Richard Roundtree, it is an American-German venture produced by Village Roadshow Pictures, Silver Pictures, Anarchos Productions, Velocity Productions and Studio Babelsberg, and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. The plot revolves around Speed Racer, an 18-year-old automobile racer who follows his apparently deceased brother's career. His choice to remain loyal to his family and their company Racer Motors causes difficulties after he refuses a contract offered by E.P. Arnold Royalton, the owner of Royalton Industries.
The film had been in development hell since 1992, having changed actors and filmmakers until in 2006 when producer Joel Silver and the Wachowskis collaborated to begin production on Speed Racer as a family film. Speed Racer was shot in and around Potsdam and Berlin from June to August 2007. Michael Giacchino composed the film's score.
Speed Racer premiered on April 26, 2008 at the Nokia Theater, followed by its general theatrical release on May 9, 2008. The film was a box office bomb, grossing only $93 million worldwide on a $120 million budget plus marketing. The film received negative reviews for its storyline, characters, dialogue and use of special effects, while also receiving praise for its score, its capacity to entertain the target audience and the performance of its cast. It was subsequently nominated in multiple categories at the Teen Choice Awards as well as the Golden Raspberry Awards. In the years since its release, Speed Racer has garnered a cult following with some commentators calling it an "underrated" film.
