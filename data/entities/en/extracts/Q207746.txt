Ben 10 (also later known as Ben 10 Classic) is an American animated series created by Man of Action (a group consisting of Duncan Rouleau, Joe Casey, Joe Kelly, and Steven T. Seagle), and produced by Cartoon Network Studios. The series is about a 10-year-old boy named Ben Tennyson who gets a watch-style alien device called the "Omnitrix". Attached to his wrist, it allows him to transform into various alien creatures. He uses these powers to fight evil from Earth and space. The series first aired on Cartoon Network as a sneak peek on December 27, 2005 as part of "Sneak Peek Week", airing alongside other shows, including My Gym Partner's a Monkey, Robotboy, and Zixx. The show later began airing on January 14, 2006 and ended on April 15, 2008.
The series gradually became popular and was nominated for two Emmy Awards, winning one for "Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation". The show would go on to spawn a franchise; Ben 10 was succeeded by Ben 10: Alien Force, Ben 10: Ultimate Alien, Ben 10: Omniverse, and was revived with a 2016â€“2017 version.
