The Farmer's Daughter is a 1947 American comedy film that tells the story of a farmgirl who ends up working as a maid for a Congressman and his politically powerful mother.  It stars Loretta Young, Joseph Cotten, Ethel Barrymore, and Charles Bickford, and was adapted by Allen Rivkin and Laura Kerr from the Finnish play Juurakon Hulda by Hella Wuolijoki, using the pen name Juhani Tervapää (misspelled in the film's credits as Juhni Tervataa).  It was directed by H.C. Potter.
The film won the Academy Award for Best Actress for Loretta Young and was nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Charles Bickford. Young's win was considered an upset; everyone had expected Rosalind Russell to win for her Lavinia in Mourning Becomes Electra.
In 1963, a television series based on the film was produced, starring Inger Stevens, Cathleen Nesbitt and William Windom.
