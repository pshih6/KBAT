Count Karl von Zinzendorf und Pottendorf (5 January 1739 â€“ 5 January 1813) was a Saxon-Austrian civil servant. He served the government of Austria in a variety of capacities, including as governor of Trieste, and rose to high rank at the Habsburg court. His massive diary, written daily over a period of about 66 years, is an important historical documentary source for his era, both in politics and in the arts.
