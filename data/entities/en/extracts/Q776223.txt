The University of Montpellier (French: Université de Montpellier) is a French public research university in Montpellier in south-east of France. Established in 1292, the University of Montpellier is one of the oldest universities in the world.
The university was split into three universities during 45 years (the University of Montpellier 1, the University of Montpellier 2 and the Paul Valéry University Montpellier 3) between 1970 and 2015 when it was subsequently reunified by the merger of the former two, with the latter, now named Paul Valéry University Montpellier, remaining a separate entity.
