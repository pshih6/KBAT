Euskaltzaindia (literally, "group of keepers of the Basque language"; often translated Royal Academy of the Basque Language) is the official academic language regulatory institution which watches over the Basque language. It carries out research on the language, seeks to protect it, and establishes standards of use. It is known in Spanish as La Real Academia de la Lengua Vasca (being under the royal patronage of the Spanish monarchy, like the Real Academia Española) and in French as Académie de la Langue Basque.
The academy was given status of a royal academy in 1976.
