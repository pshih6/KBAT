The Swiss Reformed Church (German: Evangelisch-reformierte Kirchen der Schweiz, "Evangelical Reformed Churches of Switzerland") is the Reformed branch of Protestantism in Switzerland started in Zürich in 1519 by Huldrych Zwingli (1484–1531). It spread within a few years to Basel (Johannes Oecolampadius), Bern (Berchtold Haller and Niklaus Manuel), St. Gallen (Joachim Vadian), to cities in southern Germany and via Alsace (Martin Bucer) to France.
Since 1920, the Swiss Reformed Churches have been organized in 26 member churches of the Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches. As of 2017, over two million people (out of a total population of around 8.5 million) are officially registered members of a Reformed cantonal church.
