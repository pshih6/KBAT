A few years ago he encouraged Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds to take a leap of faith and record what became the "Push the Sky Away" album at a little known studio in France called: "La Fabrique". At the time no foreign band had worked there. Since then Morrissey, RadioHead, Foals have all followed suit. Similarly with "La Frette" studios he Produced "Skeleton Tree" and then recommended it to Arctic Monkeys via Domino Record Owner Laurence Bell. Alex Turner now records all his projects there, and others have followed.
