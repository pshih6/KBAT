Odilo Globočnik (21 April 1904 – 31 May 1945) was an Austrian war criminal. He was a member of the National Socialist German Worker's Party and later a high-ranking leader of the  Schutzstaffel. As an associate of Adolf Eichmann, he had a leading role in Operation Reinhard, which saw the murder of over one million mostly Polish Jews during the Holocaust in Nazi extermination camps Majdanek, Treblinka, Sobibór and Bełżec. Historian Michael Allen described him as "the vilest individual in the vilest organization ever known".As a leading Nazi official, and perpetrator of not only the Holocaust but the enslavement and ethnic cleansing of millions of Poles and other Slavs, rumors of Globočnik's Slavic ancestry (which has been inferred from his obviously Slavic surname) has drawn the interest of historians. In his 2004 biography on Globočnik, historian Joseph Kranjc devoted the entire first chapter to the debate concerning his ancestry. He describes how Globočnik was ridiculed for his surname, in light of the Nazi classification of Slavs as sub-human (Untermenschen). But  Globočnik was defended by senior Nazis such as Himmler, who maintained that he was of Aryan origin and that his surname was the product of slavicization.
