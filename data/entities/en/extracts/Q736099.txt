Renato Carosone ([reˈnaːto karoˈzoːne]; January 3, 1920 – May 20, 2001), born Renato Carusone, was an Italian musician.
He was a prominent figure of the Italian music scene in the second half of the 20th century. He was also a modern performer of the so-called canzone napoletana, Naples' song tradition. His biggest successes in Italy were: O' Sarracino, Caravan Petrol, Tu Vuò Fà L'Americano, Maruzzella and Pigliate na pastiglia. 
He was even one of the two artists (the second one is Domenico Modugno) that sold copies in the United States without writing them in English.
