Re: Cutie Honey (Re:キューティーハニー, Ri Kyūtī Hanī) is a three-episode OVA (original video animation) series based on the 2004 tokusatsu (live-action) film Cutie Honey, both being adaptations of the 1970s manga written and illustrated by Go Nagai.  The series was co-produced with Gainax and Toei Animation, directed by Hideaki Anno, and shown on the Animax satellite television network in 2004.  The first episode aired on July 24, two months after the live-action film was released. DVD releases for each episode followed, with the first released on September 21.  The series tells the same story as the film, but contains nudity and additional character development.
