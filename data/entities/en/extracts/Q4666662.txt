Abelardo Lafuente Garcia-Rojo (1871 in Madrid â€“ 1931 in Shanghai) was a Spanish architect and entrepreneur who had his own studio in colonial Shanghai. Between 1913 and 1931 he was the only Spaniard to have an architect studio registered in the city; Lafuente collaborated with several contemporary architects. Lafuente blended the mozarab and moorish styles from Spain into Chinese architecture. In 2009, the Spanish architect Alvaro Leonardo Perez established the Lafuente Research Project. The findings of this project were first presented at the Shanghai World Expo in 2010 in collaboration with the Instituto Cervantes. The Lafuente Research Project is ongoing.
