Jovian (Latin: Flavius Jovianus Augustus; Greek: Ἰοβιανός; 331 – 17 February 364) was Roman Emperor from June 363 to February 364. As part of the imperial bodyguard, he accompanied Emperor Julian on his campaign against the Sasanian Empire and following the latter's death, Jovian was hastily declared Emperor by his soldiers. With the army exhausted, provisions running low, and unable to cross the Tigris, he sought peace with the Sasanids on humiliating terms. After his arrival at Edessa, Jovian was petitioned by bishops over doctrinal issues concerning Christianity and by September 363, he had reestablished Christianity as the state religion. His return to Constantinople would be cut short by his death at Dadastana. Jovian reigned only eight months.
