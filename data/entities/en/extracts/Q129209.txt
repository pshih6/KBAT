Henry Madison Morris (October 6, 1918 â€“ February 25, 2006) was an American young Earth creationist, Christian apologist, and engineer.  He was one of the founders of the Creation Research Society and the Institute for Creation Research.  He is considered by many to be "the father of modern creation science." He is widely known for coauthoring The Genesis Flood with John C. Whitcomb in 1961.As Morris believed in the biblical literalism and inerrancy, he opposed the billions-of-years time scales of evolution, the age of the Earth, and the age of the Universe  that he saw as being contrary to it. Morris' influential approach, while adopted widely by the modern creationist movement, continues to be rejected by the mainstream scientific community, as well as by old Earth creationists and theistic evolutionists.
