August Reinsdorf (January 1849 â€“ February 1885) was a German anarchist who is sometimes credited as being "The Father of German Anarchy."
August was a socialist anarchist who believed strongly in the rights of the workers and the common man. He attempted to assassinate the Emperor of Germany and his Princes, to end dictatorship in Germany. His plan was to blow up the Emperor's carriage with dynamite by placing it under the bridge that the Emperor's carriage was planned to take. His plan was foiled by rain, which put the fuse out, and he was discovered. He was executed in Halle on February 7, 1885.  His assassination attempt on the Emperor was one of the first acts of terror in Germany related to politics, socialism, and anarchy.
His descendants moved to America, and live there today.
