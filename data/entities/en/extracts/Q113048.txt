Franz Xaver Josef Maria Augsberger (10 October 1905 – 19 March 1945) was a high-ranking German SS commander during World War II. He was killed in action in March 1945.
Born in Austria in 1905, Franz Augsberger joined the Sturmabteilung (SA) and the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in 1930. He was in charge of the NSDAP's propaganda until June 1933, when the NSDAP was declared illegal in Austria. Augsberger moved to Germany and joined the SS in 1932. In 1934 Augsberger joined the SS-Verfügungstruppe (SS Dispositional Troops; SS-VT). He attended and then taught at an SS training school until March 1939, when he was transferred to the SS regiment Der Führer.
Augsberger was appointed the commander of a regiment in the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord. In May 1942 he was awarded the German Cross in Gold. In October 1942 Augsberger was appointed the commander of 3 Estonian SS Volunteer Brigade. In 1944 the brigade was enlarged to form the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian), with Augsberger remaining the unit's commander.  Augsberger commanded the division during the long retreat of the German forces on the Eastern Front. In early March he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross by Field Marshal Ferdinand Schörner. On 19 March, he was killed in action near Neustadt, Oberschlesien.
