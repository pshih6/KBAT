Youth Brigade was an American hardcore punk band from Washington, D.C., formed in late 1980 and disbanded in 1981.  They released the Possible EP and appeared on the Flex Your Head compilation, both on Dischord Records.  Although active for less than a year, they were nevertheless contributors to the development of D.C. hardcore punk and have influenced many other bands. Several members briefly reunited for performances in 2012 and 2013.
