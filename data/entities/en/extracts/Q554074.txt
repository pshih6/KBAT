Aleksandr Davidovich Nadiradze (Georgian: ალექსანდრე  ნადირაძე, Russian: Александр Давидович Надирадзе 20 August 1914 – 3 September 1987) was a Soviet inventor, designer and engineer in the fields of aircraft and missile / rocket technology. He developed various missiles, bombs, shells and is considered "father" of the mobile ICBMs, having created the RT-21 Temp 2S (SS-16), RSD-10 Pioneer (SS-20) and the RT-2PM Topol (SS-25). More modern weapons such as the RT-2PM2 Topol-M and RS-24 are mostly based on Nadiradze's work as well.
