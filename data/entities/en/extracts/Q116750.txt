Gonzague de Reynold (1880–1970) was a Swiss writer, historian, and right-wing political activist. 
Over the course of his six-decade career, he wrote more than thirty books outlining his traditionalist Catholic and Swiss nationalist worldview. 
De Reynold won the Schiller Prize in 1955, and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature six times.
With René de Weck and Léon Savary, he formed the troika of Fribourg writers of the early twentieth century.
