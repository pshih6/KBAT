Asterix at the Olympic Games (French: Astérix aux Jeux olympiques) is a 2008 French fantasy comedy film co–directed by Frédéric Forestier and Thomas Langmann, and written by Langmann, Alexandre Charlot and Frank Magnier, based on characters from René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo's Astérix comic series. It was filmed primarily in Spain throughout 2006.
At the time of release, it was the most expensive French and non English-speaking film of all time. The film was negatively received by critics, but performed well at several European box offices, topping charts in Poland, Spain and France. In May 2008, it received the "Gérard du cinéma" (the French equivalent of the Golden Raspberry Awards) for "Worst French Film of 2007".
