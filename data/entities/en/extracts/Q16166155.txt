The music video for recording artist Janet Jackson's single "Rhythm Nation" was directed by Dominic Sena. It was filmed as part of the long-form video Rhythm Nation 1814 Film at a power plant located in Pasadena, California. The video is notable for its "post-apocalyptic" warehouse setting, the unisex black military-style uniforms in which Jackson and her dancers were outfitted, and its choreography, considered to "set the template for hundreds of videos to come in the Nineties and aughts."
The video's outfit has received various tributes, being displayed at Walt Disney World theme park, Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's "Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power" exhibit, and the National Museum of Women in the Arts. A wax figure of Jackson wearing the outfit was also included in Madame Tussaud's exhibits in Hollywood and New York City, as well as Tussaud's Rock Circus exhibit in London. The song and choreography is also a mainstay at talent shows worldwide, and has been performed at The X Factor, Britain's Got Talent, and America's Best Dance Crew, with an Australian music show also named after the song. Various actors and choreographers, including Wade Robson and Travis Payne, have cited Jackson and the "Rhythm Nation" routine as a primary influence to their careers.
It won multiple accolades, including MTV's Video Vanguard Award for Jackson's impact on entertainment. Entertainment Weekly considered the video "legendary," and Rolling Stone included it in a list of 10 Favorite Dancing Musicians, calling Jackson "a brilliant dancer" whom it said had "arguably had a greater long-term impact on the choreography of contemporary music videos" even than her own brother Michael Jackson had had. The publication also titled it "the gold standard for dystopian dance pop music videos," featuring "some of the most memorable choreography in pop video history." The Los Angeles Times considered Janet's choreography to be "even more enthralling" than those of her contemporaries.
