Francesco Balilla Pratella (Lugo, Italy February 1, 1880 â€“ Ravenna, Italy May 17, 1955) was an Italian composer, musicologist and essayist. One of the leading advocates of futurism in Italian music, much of Pratella's own music betrays little obvious connection to the views espoused in the manifestos he authored.
