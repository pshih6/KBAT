S.E.S. (Hangul: 에스이에스; acronym for Sea, Eugene, Shoo) was a South Korean girl group formed in 1997 by SM Entertainment, with the three members: Bada, Eugene, and Shoo. Their debut album I'm Your Girl sold 650,000 copies, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in South Korea. Their follow-up album, Sea & Eugene & Shoo in 1998, Love in 1999 and A Letter from Greenland in 2000 also became best-sellers.In their early career, they were dubbed as the female counterpart of H.O.T., which were also their labelmates. S.E.S. were challenged by groups like Fin.K.L, and Baby V.O.X, which debuted around the same time and also enjoyed success.
The group officially disbanded in December 2002, after unsuccessful contract renewal negotiations with Bada and Eugene while Shoo maintained her career with SM until 2006. They released the compilation album Beautiful Songs in mid-2003 as their final release.
