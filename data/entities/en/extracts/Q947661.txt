Fantastic Four is an animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and the first animated series based on Marvel's comic book series Fantastic Four. The program, featuring character designs by Alex Toth, aired on ABC from September 9, 1967 to March 15, 1970. It lasted for 20 episodes, with repeat episodes airing on ABC for three years until the network cancelled the program. It was also rerun as part of the continuing series Hanna–Barbera's World of Super Adventure. 
Through a series of transactions, Disney currently holds the rights to the majority of Marvel's 1960s-1990s animated output (including the DePatie–Freleng Enterprises and Marvel Productions library). However, the 1967-1968 Fantastic Four was produced by Hanna-Barbera, whose library is owned by WarnerMedia, making the series one of only a handful of Marvel-related TV projects not owned by Disney (which has since acquired Marvel outright). WarnerMedia is also the owner of Marvel's biggest competitor, DC Comics.
The show was followed by another Fantastic Four cartoon produced by DePatie–Freleng Enterprises, The New Fantastic Four, in 1978.
