Sherborne School is an English independent boarding school for boys, located beside Sherborne Abbey, in the parish of Sherborne, Dorset. The school has remained in the same location for over 1,300 years. It was founded in 705 AD by St Aldhelm and, following the dissolution of the monasteries, re-founded in 1550 by King Edward VI, making it one of the oldest schools in the United Kingdom. Sherborne was one of the founder member public schools of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference in 1869, and is a member of the Eton Group.
In the public school tradition, Sherborne remains a full boarding school with boys living in one of nine boarding houses, although a few day pupils are admitted. It educates about 560 pupils, aged 13 to 18. Sherborne's A level results placed it in the top 1% of all schools in England in 2016 and 2017. The school has a partnership with Sherborne Girls, with whom it shares many academic, co-curricular and social activities.
