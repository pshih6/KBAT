Julia Lee (October 31, 1902 â€“ December 8, 1958) was an American blues and dirty blues musician. Her inclusion in the latter category is mainly due to a few numbers she performed, e.g. "King Size Papa" and "Snatch and Grab It" and "I Didn't Like It The First Time (The Spinach Song)". However, it would be misleading to characterize her music as always being in this vein.
