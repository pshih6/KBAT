Family Dog is a short-lived animated television series that aired from June 23 to July 28, 1993, on CBS. Created by Brad Bird, the series was about an average suburban family, the Binsfords, as told through the eyes of their dog named Jonah. It first appeared as a 1987 episode of the TV series Amazing Stories, then was expanded into a series of its own. The series was the first collaboration between executive producers Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton.
Delayed for years and panned by critics, the show has been called "one of the biggest fiascos in television animation history, on both a creative and commercial level, in spite (but, in many ways, because of) the high-powered talent behind the project."
