Aleksandar Obradović (Serbian Cyrillic: Александар Обрадовић) (22 August 1927 in Bled, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes – 1 April 2001 in Belgrade, Serbia, FR Yugoslavia) was a Serbian 20th-century composer and professor at the Faculty of Music in Belgrade. He was a Rector of the University of Arts in Belgrade (1979–1983).
He was a composer, music writer, and pedagogue, active primarily in the Republic of Serbia. He composed significant chamber and concertante works, but his most considerable contribution to Serbian music belongs to the genre of symphonic music. His oeuvre consists of over two hundred works. Apart from music, Obradović expressed his creativity through visual arts and writing. His paintings, conceived predominantly in watercolor technique were displayed at one individual and several group exhibitions, the former entitled Color, Sound, Word (Kolarac University, Belgrade, November 27, 1997). The book of his selected poetry Somewhere inside me was published the same year (1997).
