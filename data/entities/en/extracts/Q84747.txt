Arthur Victor Hugo Werner (15 April 1877 in Berlin â€“ 27 July 1967) was the first Mayor of Berlin after World War II. 
In 1907 Werner had graduated as an engineer at the Technical University of Charlottenburg. He ran a private technical college until 1942 when Nazi authorities forced him to retire.
On 17 May 1945 he was appointed mayor by the Soviet administration of Berlin under Nikolai Berzarin, confirmed by the western Allies after the division of the city into four sectors in July 1945. After the elections of 20 October 1946 Werner resigned in favour of Otto Ostrowski.
He was the oldest former Minister-President of Germany from gaining his office on 17 May 1945 until 28 February 1966 and was succeeded by Wilhelm Kaisen.
