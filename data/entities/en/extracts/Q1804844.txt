Langley Frederick George "Lang" Hancock (10 June 1909 â€“  27 March 1992) was an Australian iron ore magnate  from Western Australia who maintained a high profile in the spheres of business and politics.  Famous initially for discovering the world's largest iron ore deposit in 1952 and becoming one of the richest men in Australia, he is now perhaps best remembered for his marriage to the much-younger Rose Porteous, a Filipino woman and his former maid.  Hancock's daughter, Gina Rinehart, was bitterly opposed to Hancock's relationship with Porteous.  The conflicts between Rinehart and Porteous overshadowed his final years and continued until more than a decade after his death.
Aside from his extensively publicised personal life, Hancock's extreme right-wing views on the government of Australia, Indigenous Australians, and sociopolitical topics caused widespread controversy during his life.
