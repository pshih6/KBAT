Friedrich Karl Julius Schütz (31 May 1779 in Halle an der Saale – 4 September 1844 in Leipzig) was a German historian. He was the son of philologist Christian Gottfried Schütz (1747–1832).
He studied history at the universities of Jena, Erlangen and Göttingen, obtaining his habilitation in 1801 at Jena. From 1804 onward, he was an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Halle. He was the husband of actress Henriette Hendel-Schütz, with whom he accompanied on her theatrical tours — on occasion he also performed on stage.
