The town of Schwyz (German pronunciation: [ʃviːts] (listen); French: Schwytz; Italian: Svitto) is the capital of the canton of Schwyz in Switzerland.
The Federal Charter of 1291 or Bundesbrief, the charter that eventually led to the foundation of Switzerland, can be seen at the Bundesbriefmuseum.
The official language of Schwyz is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.
