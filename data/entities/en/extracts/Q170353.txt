René of Anjou (Occitan: Rainièr d'Anjau; French: René d'Anjou; 1409–1480), also known as René I of Naples (Italian: Renato I di Napoli) and Good King René (Occitan: Rai Rainièr lo Bòn; French: Le bon roi René), was count of Piedmont, Duke of Bar (1430–80), Duke of Lorraine (1431–53), Duke of Anjou, Count of Provence (1434–80), briefly King of Naples (1435–42; titular 1442–80), titular King of Jerusalem (1438–80) and Aragon including Sicily, Majorca and Corsica (1466–70).
He was a member of the House of Valois-Anjou, a cadet branch of the French royal house, and the great-grandson of John II of France (d. 1364).  He was a prince of the blood, and for most of his adult life also the brother-in-law of the reigning king Charles VII of France.  His lands were very extensive, but often contested, as was his claim to be King of Naples.
