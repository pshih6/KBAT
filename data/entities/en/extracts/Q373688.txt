Darby's Rangers (released in the UK as The Young Invaders) is a 1958 war film starring James Garner as William Orlando Darby, who organized and led the first units of United States Army Rangers during World War II. The movie was shot by Warner Brothers Studios in black and white to match wartime stock footage included in the production and was directed by William Wellman. The film was based on the 1945 book Darby's Rangers: An Illustrated Portrayal of the Original Rangers by Major James J. Altieri, himself a veteran of Darby's force.
