Gaston Henry-Haye (born 6 February 1890 at Wissous, France, died 16 October 1983 at Paris, France) was a merchant, French politician and diplomat. 
He served in the French Chamber of Deputies from 1928 to 1935, and in the French Senate from 1935-1944. He was also Mayor of Versailles from 1935-1944. Henry-Haye voted full powers to Marshal Philippe PÃ©tain on 10 July 1940, and was appointed by Petain as Ambassador of Vichy France to the United States in 1940 after the armistice between Vichy France and Germany. His photograph was featured on the cover of Time Magazine, 10 March 1941.Henry-Haye was interned by the United States in 1942, following the occupation of Vichy France by Nazi Germany. This internment of a diplomat was unusual, as no state of war existed between Vichy France and the United States. He was allowed to return to Vichy France in 1944, but escaped to South Africa after threats of death by the French Resistance. Henry-Haye returned to France in 1950. He returned to public notice in 1966 when he successfully sued author H. Montgomery Hyde for libel.
