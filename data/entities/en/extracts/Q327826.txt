Imre Bródy (1891, Gyula, Hungary–1944, Mühldorf) was a Hungarian physicist who invented in 1930 the krypton-filled fluorescent lamps (also known as the krypton electric bulb),
with fellow-Hungarian inventors Emil Theisz, Ferenc Kőrösy and Tivadar Millner. He developed the technology of the production of krypton bulbs together with Michael Polanyi (Hungarian: Polányi Mihály). He was the nephew of writer Sándor Bródy.
