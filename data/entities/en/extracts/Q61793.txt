Rahel Antonie Friederike Varnhagen (German: [ˈʁaːɛl ˈfaʁnhaːɡən]),  née Levin, later Robert (19 May 1771 – 7 March 1833)) was a German writer who hosted one of the most prominent salons in Europe during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  She is the subject of a celebrated biography, Rahel Varnhagen: The Life of a Jewess (1957), written by Hannah Arendt. Arendt cherished Varnhagen as her "closest friend, though she ha[d] been dead for some hundred years". The asteroid 100029 Varnhagen is named in her honour.
