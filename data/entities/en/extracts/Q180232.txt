Thomas Manson Norwood (April 26, 1830 â€“ June 19, 1913) was a United States Senator and Representative from Georgia. Born in Talbot County, Georgia, he pursued an academic course, and graduated from Emory College in 1850. He studied law under Georgia governor James Milton Smith, and was admitted to the bar in 1852, commencing practice in Savannah. He was a member of the Georgia House of Representatives from 1861 to 1862 and was a presidential elector on the Democratic ticket in 1868. He was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate and served from November 14, 1871, to March 3, 1877. He was a staunch critic of the Civil Rights Act of 1875. He resumed the practice of law in Savannah, and was elected as a Representative to the Forty-ninth and Fiftieth U.S. Congresses, serving from March 4, 1885, to March 3, 1889. He again resumed the practice of law, and was appointed judge of the city court of Savannah in 1896, serving twelve years. He returned to his country home, Harroch Hall, near Savannah, and died there in June 1913. Interment was in Laurel Grove Cemetery, Savannah. His posthumously published book A True Vindication of the South argued that the South had been justified in its fight against the North.
