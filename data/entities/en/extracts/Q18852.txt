Lostprophets cancelled all tour dates and announced they were disbanding in October 2013, before the end of Watkins' trial. Watkins pleaded guilty to several charges. In December 2013, he was sentenced to 29 years of imprisonment plus six years of parole. In June 2014, the remaining members teamed up with American singer Geoff Rickly to form a new band called No Devotion.
