The Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze ("academy of fine arts of Florence") is an instructional art academy in Florence, in Tuscany, in central Italy. 
It was founded by Cosimo I de' Medici in 1563, under the influence of Giorgio Vasari. Michelangelo Buonarroti, Benvenuto Cellini and other significant artists have been associated with it.  
Like other state art academies in Italy, it became an autonomous degree-awarding institution under law no. 508 dated 21 December 1999, and falls under the Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universit√† e della Ricerca, the Italian ministry of education and research.The adjacent (but unaffiliated) Galleria dell'Accademia houses the original David by Michelangelo.
