Çanakkale (pronounced [tʃaˈnakkale]) is a city and seaport in Turkey, in Çanakkale Province, on the southern coast of the Dardanelles at their narrowest point. The population of the town is 186,116 (2014 estimate).Çanakkale is the finishing point every year for an organised swim across the Dardanelles from Eceabat. This event emulates the swim in 1810 by Lord Byron, who was himself emulating the legendary swim by Leander in the story of Hero and Leander.
The city is the nearest major town to the site of ancient Troy. The wooden horse from the 2004 movie Troy is exhibited on the seafront.
