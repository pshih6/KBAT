It has over 1,482 academic staff and 32,000 students, and it is Ireland's second largest university after TU Dublin, based on 2017/18 student enrolments. UCD originates in a body founded in 1854, which opened as the Catholic University of Ireland on the Feast of Saint Malachy and with John Henry Newman as its first rector; it re-formed in 1880 and chartered in its own right in 1908. The Universities Act, 1997 renamed the constituent university as the "National University of Ireland, Dublin", and a ministerial order of 1998 renamed the institution as "University College Dublin – National University of Ireland, Dublin".Originally in locations across Dublin city, all faculties have since relocated to a 133-hectare (330-acre) campus at Belfield, four kilometres to the south of the city centre.
