He was assassinated by a prisoner during the Sobibor uprising.Graetschus joined the SS in 1935 and the Nazi Party in 1936.  He served at Bernburg Euthanasia Centre and Treblinka extermination camp before being posted to Sobibor in August 1942.  He succeeded Erich Lachmann as commander of the approximately 200 Ukrainian Trawniki guards at Sobibor.Graetschus was killed during the prisoner revolt at Sobibor.
