Negima!? (ネギま!?) is an anime television series created by Shaft. It is an alternate retelling of the Negima! Magister Negi Magi series. Directed by Akiyuki Shinbo, it aired from October 4, 2006 to March 28, 2007 in Japan. The anime was accompanied by a monthly manga series by Takuya Fujima called Negima!? neo. Both series feature the same characters and locations. This new season aired on TV Tokyo's late afternoon time slot rather than on late nights, like the original anime series did.
