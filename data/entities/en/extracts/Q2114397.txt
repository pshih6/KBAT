The current head of the Sultanate is Hamengkubuwono X.Yogyakarta existed as a state since 1755 on the territory of modern Indonesia in the central part of Java Island. The Sultanate became the main theater of military operations during the Javan war of 1825–1830, following which a significant part of its territory was annexed by the Dutch, and the degree of autonomy was significantly curtailed. In 1946–1948, during the war of independence of Indonesia, the capital of the republic was transferred to the territory of the sultanate, in the city of Yogyakarta.
In 1950, Yogyakarta became part of Indonesia as a special region, on the status equal to a province. At the same time, the hereditary sultan's title and some ceremonial privileges were legally secured for its rulers. The sultanate is claimed to own almost 10% of Yogyakarta's land.
