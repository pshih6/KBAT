Prince Wilhelm of Wied (German: Wilhelm Friedrich Heinrich, Albanian: Princ Vidi or Princ Vilhelm Vidi, 26 March 1876 – 18 April 1945), reigned briefly as sovereign of the Principality of Albania as Vidi I (Albanian: Vidi i parë) from 7 March to 3 September 1914, when he left for exile. His reign officially came to an end on 31 January 1925, when the country was declared an Albanian Republic.
Outside the country and in diplomatic correspondence, he was styled "sovereign prince", but in Albania, he was referred to as mbret, or king. He was also styled Skanderbeg II, in homage to Skanderbeg, the national hero.
