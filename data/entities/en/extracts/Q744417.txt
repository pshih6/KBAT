Italo disco (various capitalized, and sometimes hyphenated as Italo-disco) is a music genre which originated in Italy and was mainly produced from the late 1970s to the late 1980s. Italo disco evolved from the then-current underground dance, pop, and electronic music, both domestic and foreign (American Hi-NRG, French Euro disco) and developed into a diverse genre. The genre employs drum machines, synthesizers, and occasionally vocoders. It is usually sung in English, and to a lesser extent in Italian and Spanish.
The origin of the genre's name is strongly tied to marketing efforts of the ZYX record label, which began licensing and marketing the music outside Italy in 1982. Italo disco faded in the early 1990s.
