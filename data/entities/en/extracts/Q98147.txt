Hugo Döblin (29 October 1876 – 4 November 1960) was a German stage and film actor. He appeared in more than eighty films, most of them during the silent era. The Jewish Döblin left German following the Nazi Party's rise to power in 1933, and after moving first to Czechoslovakia and Austria, eventually settled in Switzerland. His younger brother was novelist, essayist, and doctor Alfred Döblin (1878–1957).
