The Labour Party (Irish: Páirtí an Lucht Oibre) is a social democratic political party in the Republic of Ireland. Founded in 1912 in Clonmel, County Tipperary, by James Larkin, James Connolly, and William X. O'Brien as the political wing of the Irish Trades Union Congress, it describes itself as a "democratic socialist party" in its constitution. Labour continues to be the political arm of the Irish trade union and labour movement and seeks to represent workers' interests in the Dáil and on a local level.
Unlike the other main Irish political parties, Labour did not arise as a faction of the original Sinn Féin party (although it incorporated Democratic Left in 1999, a party that did trace its origins back to Sinn Féin). The party has served as a partner in coalition governments on seven occasions since its formation: six times in coalition either with Fine Gael alone or with Fine Gael and other smaller parties, and once with Fianna Fáil. This gives Labour a cumulative total of nineteen years served as part of a government, the second-longest total of any party in the Republic of Ireland after Fianna Fáil. The current party leader is Alan Kelly. It is currently the joint-fifth-largest party in Dáil Éireann, with six seats.
In November 2018, Labour announced that they were considering running candidates again in Northern Ireland, in response to a potential merger between Fianna Fáil and the Social Democratic and Labour Party, with whom Labour have long had fraternal links. The last time Labour had contested elections in the region was in 1973, shortly after the SDLP's formation.The Labour Party is a member of the Progressive Alliance, Socialist International, and Party of European Socialists (PES).
