Manuel Asur (Manuel Asur GONZÁLEZ GARCÍA) (Güeria Carrocera, San Martín del Rey Aurelio, Asturias, 1947) is a Spanish essayist and poet in Asturian. He's considered to be one of the first modern poets in this language. He has a Ph.D degree in Philosophy. His book, Cancios y poemes pa un riscar ('Songs and Poems to a Dawn') meant the beginning in 1977 of the rebirth (Asturian surdimientu) of asturian literature, because he contributed with a poetry more newfangled and risked than anything written before in this language. Most of their works talk about the socio-political facts of the moment. Some of their poems became very popular in Asturias in the 1970s since the group Nuberu used them as lyrics for their songs. He wrote also a narrative book in 1987, Hai una llinia trazada ('There's a Drawn Line'), with short stories that he say to consider "almost monologues". He's a current articulist of La Nueva España publications and works in the Consejería de Medio Rural y Pesca del Principado de Asturias.
