After the November 2011 banning of the participation of blocs of political parties in parliamentary elections, Batkivshchyna became a major force in Ukrainian politics independently.In the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election Batkivshchyna took part under the banner "United opposition Batkivshchyna" and other parties allied with Batkivshchyna.

On 15 June 2013 the parties "Front of Changes" and "Reforms and Order" finally merged with the All-Ukrainian Union Batkivshchyna by self-liquidation. By 31 December 2013 the parliamentary faction Batkivshchyna had 90 deputies.Yulia Tymoshenko was imprisoned from 5 August 2011 until 22 February 2014.
