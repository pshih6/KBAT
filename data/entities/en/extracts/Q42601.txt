David Désiré Marc Ginola (French pronunciation: ​[david ʒinola]; born 25 January 1967) is a French former international football player who has also worked as an actor, model and football pundit.
Ginola was born in Gassin, a commune in the Var department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in southeastern France. A former forward, he played football for ten seasons in his native France before making the move from Paris Saint-Germain to Newcastle United in the English Premier League in July 1995. He continued playing in the Premier League for Tottenham Hotspur, Aston Villa and Everton before retiring in 2002.
Since his retirement from the game he has become involved in several new pursuits, including acting. Ginola is a regular contributor to BBC, BT and CNN. He hosts 'Match of ze Day' ('MozD'), a program which broadcasts live Premier League matches on Canal+.
On 16 January 2015, Ginola announced his intention to run for the FIFA presidency. However, 14 days later, on 30 January 2015, Ginola withdrew his bid for the FIFA presidency, after failing to receive the required backing of at least five national football associations.
