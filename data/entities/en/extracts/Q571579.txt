Please Save My Earth (Japanese: ぼくの地球を守って, Hepburn: Boku no Chikyū o Mamotte), sometimes abbreviated Bokutama, is a shōjo manga by Saki Hiwatari. It was published by Hakusensha from 1986 to 1994 in the magazine Hana to Yume and collected in 21 volumes (tankōbon). The series was adapted as a six-part original video animation (OVA) in 1993. It is about six teenagers and a seven-year-old boy who share common dreams about their past lives as alien scientists who observed the Earth from the Moon. Both the anime OVA and manga are licensed for distribution in North America by Viz Media.
A sequel manga, Embraced by the Moonlight, was serialized in the bimonthly Hana to Yume as well as the special edition magazine, Hana to Yume Plus. It has since been followed by I Sing with the Earth.
