The Liberal Party of the Philippines (Filipino: Partido Liberal ng Pilipinas), or LP, is a liberal political party in the Philippines, founded by then-senators Senate President Manuel Roxas, Senate President Pro-Tempore Elpidio Quirino, and former 9th Senatorial District Senator Jos√© Avelino on January 19, 1946. It is originally a breakaway liberal wing of the old Nacionalista Party. It was the ruling party from 2010 to 2016 after the election victory of Benigno Aquino III as the President of the Philippines. The Liberals lost control in the 2016 presidential election and became the leading opposition party. As of the 2019 midterm elections, the Liberals are still the primary opposition party and hold only three seats in the Senate, 18 seats in the House of Representatives, two provincial governorships, and five vice governorships. 
The Liberal Party is the second oldest extant political party in the Philippines in terms of date of establishment, and the oldest continually-active political party in the Philippines. The party has been led by liberal thinkers and pro-development politicians like Manuel Roxas, Elpidio Quirino, Diosdado Macapagal, Gerry Roxas, Benigno Aquino, Jr., Jovito Salonga, Raul Daza, Florencio B. Abad Jr., Franklin Drilon, Mar Roxas, and Benigno Aquino III. Two of its members, Corazon Aquino and Leila de Lima, have received the prestigious Prize for Freedom, the highest international award for liberal and democratic politicians since 1985.
