NASA Astronaut Group 15 ("The Flying Escargot") was a group of 23 NASA astronauts selected in 1994. The group name for these astronaut trainees was originally Slugs because no group was convened the previous year and thus the group was slow in arriving.  Group members adopted The Flying Escargot as their moniker, possibly in reference to two members of the group being from France, or in reference to the famous "flying escargot" scene in the movie Pretty Woman. The group featured ten pilots, nine mission specialists, and four international mission specialist trainees.
