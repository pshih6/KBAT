Wilhelm Boden (March 5, 1890 â€“ October 18, 1961) was a German lawyer, civil servant and politician (center, CDU). From 1946 to 1947 he was the 1st Minister President of Rhineland-Palatinate.He contributed substantially to the rebuilding of the administration and to the formation of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, where he continued former Prussian administrative traditions. On December 1, 1946, Boden was appointed by the French military government as prime minister of the "Provisional Government" of Rheinland-Pfalz with the mission to prepare a draft constitution and conduct elections. After the election on May 18, 1947 he became minister president of a "transitional Cabinet" but failed to form a government; the SPD denied him the coalition as he was considered controversial even within the party, so the leadership of the affairs of the newly created state passed to Peter Altmeier.
