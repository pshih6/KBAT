Televisión Española (acronym TVE, or lowercase letters: tve, in English "Spanish Television") is the national state-owned public-service television broadcaster in Spain. TVE belongs to the RTVE Corporation, which has overall responsibility for national public-service radio and television under a Parliament-appointed General Manager who, in addition to being answerable to a Board of Directors, reports to an all-party committee of the national parliament, as provided for in the Public Radio and Television Law of 2006.
TVE's activities were previously financed by a combination of advertising revenue and subsidies from the national government, but since January 2010, it has been supported by subsidies only.
