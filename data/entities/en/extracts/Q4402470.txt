The Asia University of Japan (亜細亜大学, Ajia Daigaku) is a private university located in Musashino, Tokyo, Japan that offers courses in Business Administration, Economics, Law, International Relations and Urban Innovation.
The university was founded in 1941 by Kozo Ota as Koa Senmon Gakko (Koa Professional School) on the site of the present Asia University campus. Ota believed that education should be based on a spiritual closeness between teachers and students. It was a unique school at the time, as it accommodated all students in dormitories divided by course of study; Continental Asia, Southern Pacific Islands and Japan ("Homeland").
It shares its name with another university located in Taiwan.
The University produced an animated short, in 2015, to promote its Department of Urban Innovation.
