A time loop or temporal loop in fiction is a plot device whereby characters re-experience a span of time which is repeated, sometimes more than once, with some hope of breaking out of the cycle of repetition. The term "time loop" is sometimes used to refer to a causal loop; however, causal loops are unchanging and self-originating, whereas time loops are constantly resetting: when a certain condition is met, such as a death of a character or a clock reaches a certain time, the loop starts again, with one or more characters retaining the memories from the previous loop.An early example of a time loop is used in the short story "Doubled and Redoubled" by Malcolm Jameson that appeared in the February 1941 Unknown. The story tells of a person accidentally cursed to repeat a "perfect" day, including a lucky bet, a promotion, a heroically foiled bank robbery, and a successful wedding proposal. Other early examples include Yasutaka Tsutsui's 1965 Japanese novel The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (later adapted into a 1972 TV series, 1983 film, and 2006 anime film), the 1973 short story 12:01 PM and its 1990 film, the Soviet film Mirror for a Hero (1988), and the film Groundhog Day (1993).  The time loop is considered a familiar Japanese anime trope, since its use in the 1980s anime works Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer (1984) and Kimagure Orange Road (1987).
