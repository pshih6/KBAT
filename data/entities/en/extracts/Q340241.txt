Achille Peretti (13 June 1911 – 14 April 1983), was a French politician.
Peretti was born in Ajaccio. A lawyer by profession, he was a member of the French resistance, and was in charge of security of Charles de Gaulle's government in Algiers.
After the war, Peretti pursued a business career. A member of the French parliament from 1958 to his death, he became chairman of the National Assembly in 1969 when Jacques Chaban-Delmas was nominated as prime minister. After the right-wing coalition's narrow victory in the 1973 elections, he had to step down and was replaced by Edgar Faure.
Peretti was the mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine from 1947 until his death. He was succeeded by Nicolas Sarkozy who had become his political protégé.
