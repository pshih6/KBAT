Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University (formerly known as Russian State Medical University or RSMU) is a medical education institute in Moscow, Russia founded in 1906. It is fully accredited and recognized by Russia's Ministry of Education and Science and is currently under the authority of the Ministry of Health and Social Development.Named after Russian surgeon and pedagogue N.I. Pirogov (1810-1888), it is one of the largest medical institutions and the first university in Russia to allow women to acquire degrees.
It is especially notable in comparison to Moscow's other two premier medical universities in that it focuses on gearing students for careers in medical and scientific research, rather than medical practice.
