Crystal Gayle (born Brenda Gail Webb; January 9, 1951) is an American country music singer and songwriter. Originally  under the guidance of sister Loretta Lynn, Gayle soon developed her own MOR style. This new musical direction made her one of the most successful crossover artists of the 1970s and 80s. She is also noted for her floor-length hair.Gayle began her career in the 1960s performing in the background of her siblings' bands, most notably Loretta Lynn. Lynn helped her sign a recording contract with Decca Records in 1970. Having minor success, she was encouraged to develop her own musical identity. Under the direction of producer Allen Reynolds at United Artists Records, Gayle shifted towards a country pop style that was more successful. In 1975, "Wrong Road Again" became Gayle's first major hit. However, it was in 1977 when Gayle achieved her biggest success with the single "Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue". The song topped the Billboard country chart, crossed over to the top five of the Billboard Hot 100, and became a major international hit.
Gayle continued having major country pop success from the late 1970s and through late 1980s. Her biggest hits included "Ready for the Times to Get Better" (1977), "Talking in Your Sleep" (1978), "Half the Way" (1979) and "You and I" (1982). In the 1990s, Gayle shifted artistic directions by recording various genres of music. This included an album of inspirational music entitled Someday (1995) and an album of standards called Crystal Gayle Sings the Heart and Soul of Hoagy Carmichael (1999). During the decade she also owned and operated a fine arts shop called "Crystal's Fine Gifts and Jewelry". Her most recent studio release appeared in 2019 and Gayle has since continued to tour throughout the world.

She has also won five Academy of Country Music awards; those awards include receiving the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award in 2016.
