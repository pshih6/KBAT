Luman Hamlin Weller (August 24, 1833 â€“ March 2, 1914) was a United States Greenback Party member. In the 1880s, he served a single term in the United States House of Representatives as a representative of Iowa's 4th congressional district, then in rural northeastern Iowa. Once elected, he became nationally known as "Calamity" Weller, and did not survive his next election. He later went on to become one of the leading Populists in Iowa.
