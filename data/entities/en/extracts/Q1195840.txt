One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e (One ～輝く季節へ～, lit. One ~To the Radiant Season~) is a Japanese adult visual novel, developed by Tactics, a brand of Nexton, released on May 29, 1998 playable on Windows PCs. The erotic content was later removed when the game was ported to the PlayStation. The story follows the life of Kōhei Orihara, a high school student who has fun spending time with several girls about his age, while at the same time he is gradually being drawn into a mystical alternate space known as the Eternal World.
The gameplay in One follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the six female main characters by the player character. The game ranked several times in the national top 50 for best-selling PC games sold in Japan. A sequel loosely based on One titled One2: Eien no Yakusoku was produced by BaseSon, another brand under Nexton, and was released in April 2002.
Much of the staff that created the game later became the founding members of the visual novel brand Key. KSS produced a four-episode all ages original video animation (OVA) series between 2001 and 2002 titled One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e. Cherry Lips produced a three-episode adult OVA series between 2003 and 2004 titled One: True Stories. One: True Stories was later licensed for English language distribution by Media Blasters. Comic anthologies and four novels were also published, as were audio dramas.
