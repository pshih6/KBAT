The Eagle  is a 2011  epic historical drama film set in Roman Britain directed by Kevin Macdonald, and starring Channing Tatum, Jamie Bell and Donald Sutherland. Adapted by Jeremy Brock from Rosemary Sutcliff's historical adventure novel The Eagle of the Ninth (1954), the film tells the story of a young Roman officer attempting to recover the lost Roman eagle standard of his father's legion in Scotland. The story is based on the Ninth Spanish Legion's supposed disappearance in Britain.
The film was an Anglo-American co-production. It was released in the U.S. and Canada on 11 February 2011, and in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 25 March 2011.
Historically, the purported disappearance of the Ninth Legion in Northern Britain is a subject of debate and dispute (see Legio IX Hispana ยง Theories about the Ninth's disappearance for details.)
