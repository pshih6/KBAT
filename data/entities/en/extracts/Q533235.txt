The Ateneo de Manila University (Filipino: Pamantasang Ateneo de Manila; Spanish: Universidad Ateneo de Manila), also known simply as the Ateneo de Manila or Ateneo and abbreviated as AdMU, is a private Catholic Jesuit research university in Quezon City, Philippines. Founded in 1859 by the Society of Jesus, Ateneo is the third-oldest university in the Philippines. 
Ateneo offers elementary and junior high school education exclusively to male students, while its senior high school and college are co-educational. In college, both undergraduate and graduate programs are organized into four schools, collectively known as the Loyola Schools, which are located at its main campus at Loyola Heights along with the Grade School, Junior High School and Senior High School. Four professional schools occupy other campuses throughout Metro Manila. Students of Ateneo are often referred to as Ateneans (Filipino: mga Atenista).
Ateneo undergraduates follow a Catholic-rooted liberal arts core curriculum throughout their program in the Loyola Schools.
As of 2020, Ateneo alumni include one Nobel Peace Prize recipient, two Ramon Magsaysay awardees, Jos√© Rizal (the national hero of the Philippines), five Presidents of the Philippines, and five Chief Justices of the Philippine Supreme Court. In the 1890s, among its graduates were several leaders of the propaganda movement during the Philippine Revolution against Spain. United Kingdom-based Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) ranks ADMU as the country's top private university, among the top 125 Asian universities, and among the top 600 universities worldwide in annual university rankings.
