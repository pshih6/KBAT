Béatrice Schönberg (née Béatrice Szabo; 9 May 1953) is a French television journalist.
She anchored the newscasts on La Cinq from 1987 to 1992 and on France 2 from 1997 to 2007.
She was formerly married to the musician and composer Claude-Michel Schönberg.
On 21 July 2005 she married the French politician Jean-Louis Borloo at Rueil-Malmaison, Hauts-de-Seine. The journalists' union SDJ (Société des journalistes) then called for her resignation.
In September 2006, France 2 announced they had come to an agreement with Ms. Schönberg.  Effective 25 February 2007, she was replaced by Laurent Delahousse, but would continue with the network as the host of a prime-time science program.  She did not return after the second part of the presidential election in May 2007 because her husband was given a cabinet post in President Nicolas Sarkozy's government.
