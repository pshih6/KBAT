Werner Willi Max Eiselen (1899–1977) was a South African anthropologist and linguist.  He was an ally and associate of Hendrik Verwoerd, the Minister of Native Affairs from 1950–1958 and the Prime Minister of South Africa from 1958–1966.  He led the Eiselen Commission, an advisory board that investigated native education and formed the basis of the Bantu Education Act of 1953 which moved control of education of South Africa's blacks from missionary schools to local government control.  It also made starting a "Bantu" school without permission and registration from the government illegal.Eiselen was a supporter of apartheid; he believed that it would be better for both white and black South Africans.  Eiselen was fluent in a number of African languages and studied a number of South Africa's native tribes.  Eiselen's books and works were commonly cited by the National Party and pro-apartheid South Africans, and he is sometimes referred to as an "intellectual architect" of the system.
