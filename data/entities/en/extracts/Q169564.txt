Carnage is a 2011 black comedy film directed by Roman Polanski, based on the Tony Award-winning play Le Dieu du carnage by French playwright Yasmina Reza. The screenplay is by Reza and Polanski. The film is an international co-production of France, Germany, Poland, and Spain. It stars Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet, Christoph Waltz, and John C. Reilly.
In the film, presented in a classic case of much ado about nothing, two sets of parents try to resolve a situation in a civilised manner. But, the actual matter aside, it is their own idiosyncrasies that rise to the surface.
Carnage premiered at the 2011 Venice International Film Festival on 1 September 2011, where it competed for the Golden Lion. It was theatrically released on 18 November 2011. The film received positive reviews with critics drawing major acclaim towards the performances of Foster and Winslet and Polanski's direction.
At the 69th Golden Globe Awards, Foster and Winslet received nominations for Best Actress â€“ Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. It is currently Polanski's last film to be shot in English.
