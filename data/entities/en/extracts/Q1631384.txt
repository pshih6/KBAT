The Quebec Liberal Party (QLP; French: Parti libéral du Québec, PLQ) is a federalist provincial political party in Quebec, Canada. It has been independent of the federal Liberal Party of Canada since 1955.
The party has traditionally supported a form of Quebec federalism that supports Quebec remaining within the Canadian federation while also supporting reforms that would allow Quebec substantial autonomy. While the party has been described as centrist in the context of Canadian politics, the party believes in a strong role for government in the economy and supports socially liberal policies. The party has a social-democratic faction which was especially prominent during the Quiet Revolution.The Quebec Liberals have always been associated with the colour red; each of their main opponents in different eras have been generally associated with the colour blue.
