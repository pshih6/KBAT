Marius Lavet (Clermont-Ferrand, February 8, 1894 - Paris, February 14, 1980) was a French engineer who invented in 1936 the principle of stepper motor. He studied at Sup√©lec, the School of Electric Power, French private engineering school.
A stepper motor can turn an electrical impulse in angular movement. This type of engine is very common in all devices where it is desirable to control the speed or position in open loop, usually in positioning systems. The invention of Lavet is enshrined in French Patent FR823395 and was instrumental, among other applications, for the development of watches with quartz mechanism, using the principle known as the piezoelectric. Quartz watches are today largely predominate in the world for its low price and its high precision, coming to have a negligible deviation for comuns citizens.
