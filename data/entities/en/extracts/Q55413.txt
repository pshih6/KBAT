William Dieterle (July 15, 1893 â€“ December 9, 1972) was a German-American actor and film director, who emigrated to the United States in 1930 to leave a worsening political situation. He worked in Hollywood primarily as a director for much of his career, becoming a United States citizen in 1937. 
His best-known films include The Devil and Daniel Webster, The Story of Louis Pasteur (1936) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. His 1937 film The Life of Emile Zola won the Academy Award for Best Picture, the second biographical feature to do so.
