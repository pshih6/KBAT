Castle Keep is a 1969 American Technicolor comedy-drama war film combining surrealism with tragic realism filmed in Panavision.  It was directed by Sydney Pollack and starred Burt Lancaster, Patrick O'Neal, Jean-Pierre Aumont, Bruce Dern, and Peter Falk. The film appeared in the summer of 1969, a few months before the arrival of Pollack's smash hit They Shoot Horses, Don't They?.
The film is based on a novel by William Eastlake published in 1965. Eastlake enlisted in the United States Army in 1942. He served in the Infantry for four and a half years, and was wounded while leading a platoon during the Battle of the Bulge.
