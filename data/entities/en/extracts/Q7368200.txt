Rosehill Cemetery (founded 1859) is an American rural cemetery on the North Side of Chicago, Illinois, and at 350 acres (1.4 km2), is the largest cemetery in the City of Chicago. The name "Rosehill" resulted from a City Clerk's error â€“ the area was previously called "Roe's Hill", named for nearby farmer Hiram Roe.  He refused to sell his land to the city until it was promised that the cemetery be named in his honor.  It is located in the north east section of the Lincoln Square community area.
Rosehill's Joliet-limestone entrance gate (added in 1864) was designed by William W. Boyington, the architect of the Chicago Water Tower and the Old University of Chicago, who is buried in Rosehill.  The Rosehill Cemetery Administration Building and Entry Gate was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1975.Like its sister cemetery Graceland, Rosehill is the burial place of many well-known Chicagoans. The cemetery contains many monuments that are notable for their beauty and eccentricity, such as that of Lulu Fellows.The cemetery is also the final resting place of 61 victims of the Iroquois Theatre fire, in which over 600 people died.Several graves from the old City Cemetery, originally located in what is now Lincoln Park were relocated to Rosehill.  Some of the gravestones and monuments were also moved to Rosehill Cemetery and can be seen.
