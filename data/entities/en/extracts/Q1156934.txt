The Peabody Institute of The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) is a music and dance conservatory and university-preparatory school in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood of northern Baltimore, Maryland, United States, facing the landmark Washington Monument circle at the southeast corner of North Charles and East Monument Streets (also known as intersection of Mount Vernon Place and Washington Place).
The Peabody Institute was founded in 1857 and opened in 1866 by merchant/ financier and philanthropist George Peabody, (1795â€“1869), and is the oldest conservatory in the United States. Its association in recent decades begun in 1977 with JHU allows students to do research across disciplines.
