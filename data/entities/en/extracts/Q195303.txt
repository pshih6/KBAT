Barfly is a 1987 American comedy drama film directed by Barbet Schroeder and starring Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunaway. The film is a semi-autobiography of poet/author Charles Bukowski during the time he spent drinking heavily in Los Angeles, and it presents Bukowski's alter ego Henry Chinaski. The screenplay, written by Bukowski, was commissioned by the French film director Barbet Schroeder, and it was published (with illustrations by the author) in 1984, when film production was still pending.The Kino Flo light, now a ubiquitous tool in the film industry, was specially created by Robby MÃ¼ller's electrical crew for a scene in this film, which would have been difficult to light using the conventional lampheads available at the time.
The film was "presented by" Francis Ford Coppola, and features a silent cameo appearance by Bukowski himself. It was entered into the 1987 Cannes Film Festival.
