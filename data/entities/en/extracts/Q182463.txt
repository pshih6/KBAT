Pope Benedict IV (Latin: Benedictus IV; died 30 July 903) was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from 1 February 900 to his death.  The tenth-century historian Flodoard, who nicknamed him "the Great", commended his noble birth and public generosity.
Benedict was a native of Rome, the son of one Mammalus, and was ordained priest by Pope Formosus. He succeeded Pope John IX. In 900, he excommunicated Count Baldwin II of Flanders for murdering Archbishop Fulk of Reims. In 901, Benedict crowned Louis the Blind as emperor. In 902, Berengar of Friuli defeated Louis III and forced him to leave Italy. Benedict died in Rome during the summer of 903; it is possible that Berengar had some involvement. Benedict was buried in front of St Peter's Basilica, by the gate of Guido. He was followed by Pope Leo V.
