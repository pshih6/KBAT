Lobsang Sangay (Tibetan: བློ་བཟང་སེང་གེ་, "kind-hearted lion"; born September 5, 1968) is a Tibetan politician who is the Sikyong (President) of the Tibetan-government-in-exile, officially known as Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) since 2012 and previously served as Kalön Tripa from 2011 to 2012. Following his election, at the request of the 14th Dalai Lama, the Tibetan parliament-in-exile amended the organisation's bylaws to remove the Dalai Lama's executive authority, making Lobsang Sangay its highest leader. In 2012, to reflect this change, Lobsang Sangay's title as chief executive was changed from kalön tripa ("prime minister") to sikyong ("ruler" or "regent").
Sangay was born in Darjeeling, India and studied international law and democracy at Harvard University. and holds American citizenship.
