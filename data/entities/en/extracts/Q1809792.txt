Le Charivari was an illustrated magazine published in Paris, France, from 1832 to 1937.  It published caricatures, political cartoons and reviews. After 1835, when  the government banned political caricature, Le Charivari began publishing satires of everyday life.  The name refers to the folk practice of holding a charivari, a loud, riotous parade, to shame or punish wrongdoers.
