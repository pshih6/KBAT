Dirk Coster (October 5, 1889 â€“ February 12, 1950), was a Dutch physicist. He was a Professor of Physics and Meteorology at the University of Groningen. 
Coster was born in Amsterdam. On February 26, 1919, he married Lina Maria Wijsman, who held a degree in Oriental languages.  Eventually, she was one of the first women to obtain a doctorate degree in this field from the University of Leiden.  Dirk and Miep had two sons and two daughters (Hendrik, Ada, Els, and Herman).  Coster is known as the co-discoverer of Hafnium (Hf) (element 72) in 1923, along with George de Hevesy, by means of X-ray spectroscopic analysis of zirconium ore. The discovery took place in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Hafnia is the Latin name for Copenhagen.
