Granma is the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party. It was formed in 1965 by the merger of two previous papers, Revoluci√≥n and Hoy. Publication of the newspaper began in February of 1966. Its name comes from the yacht Granma that carried Fidel Castro and 81 other rebels to Cuba's shores in 1956, launching the Cuban Revolution. The newspaper has been a way for Fidel Castro and the Cuban Communist Party to communicate their ideology to the world, especially in regards to the United States. Marta Rojas worked for the paper since its founding.
