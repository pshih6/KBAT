Paul Justin von Breitenbach (April 16, 1850 â€“ March 10, 1930) was a Prussian politician and railway planner.
Breitenbach was central to the building of the underground in Berlin, specifically the line between the city center and Berlin-Dahlem (today U3). The Breitenbachplatz in Dahlem was named after him in 1913.
