Lauren Savoy is an American composer, director and writer. She is married to Paul Waaktaar-Savoy from the band a-ha. In 1999 they had a son together.
The a-ha song "Angel In The Snow" was written for Savoy by Paul Waaktaar-Savoy and he played it to her on their wedding day. He was too shy to make a speech, so he wrote a song instead.
Upon graduation from the London Film School, Lauren started directing music videos and commercials. She has original songs in the movie "Hawaii, Oslo" as well as "A Night at Mcool's."
In 1995, Savoy and her husband formed the band "Savoy" with drummer Frode Unneland. Lauren is credited as co-writer on all Savoy albums.
