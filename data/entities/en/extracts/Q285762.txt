Paris Underground, also known as Madame Pimpernel, is a 1945 film directed by Gregory Ratoff, and based on the memoir of the same title by Etta Shiber.
The film stars Constance Bennett and Gracie Fields as an American and an Englishwoman trapped in Paris when Nazi Germany invades in 1940, who rescue British airmen shot down in France and help them escape across the English Channel. This was also Bennett's only producing credit. The film's sets were designed by the art director Nicolai Remisoff.
Alexandre Tansman was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score (one of 21 nominations that year).
