28 Days Later is a 2002 British post-apocalyptic horror film directed by Danny Boyle, written by Alex Garland, and starring Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Christopher Eccleston, Megan Burns, and Brendan Gleeson. The plot depicts the breakdown of society following the accidental release of a highly contagious virus and focuses upon the struggle of four survivors (Murphy, Harris, Burns, and Gleeson) to cope with the destruction of the life they once knew while evading those infected by the virus.
The film received critical acclaim. Many praised the performances, screenplay, atmosphere, and soundtrack. The film is credited with reinvigorating the zombie genre of horror film, as well as increasing the popularity of fast-moving zombies (while Dan O'Bannon's 1985 film The Return of the Living Dead featured the first example of "fast zombies" in cinema, the concept was largely neglected in media until after the release of 28 Days Later). It was also a financial success, grossing more than $82.7 million worldwide on its modest budget of $8 million and becoming one of the most profitable horror films of 2002.
It was followed by a 2007 sequel, 28 Weeks Later, a graphic novel titled 28 Days Later: The Aftermath, which expands on the timeline of the outbreak, and a 2009 comic book series titled 28 Days Later. In 2017 a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for Time Out magazine  ranked it the 97th best British film ever.
