The Mid-American Conference (MAC) is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I collegiate athletic conference with a membership base in the Great Lakes region that stretches from Western New York to Illinois.  Nine of the twelve full member schools are in Ohio and Michigan, with single members located in Illinois, Indiana, and New York. For football, the MAC participates in the NCAA's Football Bowl Subdivision.
The MAC is headquartered in the Public Square district in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, and has two members in the nearby Akron area.  The MAC has been referred to as the "Conference of Quarterbacks" because of the accomplishments of numerous former players in the National Football League.  The conference also ranks highest among all ten NCAA Division I FBS conferences for graduation rates.
