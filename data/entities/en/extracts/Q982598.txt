Robson Caetano da Silva (born September 4, 1964 in Rio de Janeiro) is the most successful Brazilian sprinter to date. He participated in four consecutive Olympic Summer Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 1996) and won the bronze medal over 200 metres in the 1988 Seoul Olympics as well as in the 4Ã—100 m relay in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
Possibly Da Silva's greatest achievement was a series of three victories at World Cup competitions (1985, 1989, and 1992) over 200 m. In his career, da Silva set two South American records over 100 metres and five over 200 m. In 1989, he was ranked No. 1 in the world with a time of 19.96 s over 200 m. His personal best of 10.00 makes him the fastest South American in history.
Regarding performance-enhancing drugs, Da Silva has stated he decided "not to take [PED's] and lose because it was a matter of character [and] dignity".
