Ludwig Hohl (9 April 1904 â€“ 3 November 1980) was a Swiss author writing in the German language. Outside of literary mainstream, he spent most of his life in extreme poverty. He is still unknown to a wider public but has been praised by several well-known authors for his writing and his radical thinking about life and literature.
