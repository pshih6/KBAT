Nurmijärvi (Finnish pronunciation: [ˈnurmiˌjærʋi]) is the most populated rural municipality of Finland, located 37 kilometres (23 mi) north of the capital Helsinki. The neighboring municipalities of Nurmijärvi are Espoo, Vantaa, Tuusula, Hyvinkää and Vihti, and it is part of the Greater Helsinki. The population of the municipality is 42,709 inhabitants.The close proximity to Helsinki has led to a considerable growth of the major villages such as Klaukkala, Rajamäki and Röykkä. Klaukkala is the biggest built-up area of Nurmijärvi, which nowadays is considered a dormitory town of Helsinki. The church village (Kirkonkylä) is the administrative centre of the municipality.
Nurmijärvi literally means "lawn lake" although the lake that gave the municipality its name was drained in the early 20th century and is now nothing more than some flat fields near the village centre. Nurmijärvi is one of three municipalities in the Uusimaa region that do not have a Swedish name; the others are Askola and Mäntsälä.
Nurmijärvi is best known as the birthplace of Finland's national author, Aleksis Kivi. The coat of arms of municipality refers to his most famous literal work, Seitsemän veljestä (literally translated "the seven brothers") from 1870. On January 29, 2020, Nurmijärvi declared itself officially the Capital of Aleksis Kivi.Matti Vanhanen, former Prime Minister of Finland, lives in Lepsämä in Nurmijärvi.
