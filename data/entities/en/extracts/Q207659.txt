Space Jam is a 1996 American live-action/animated sports comedy film directed by Joe Pytka. Starring Michael Jordan, the film presents a fictionalized account of what happened between Jordan's initial retirement from the NBA in 1993 and his comeback in 1995, in which he is enlisted by the Looney Tunes to help them win their freedom in a basketball match against the Monstars working for Mr. Swackhammer, the ruthless owner of the intergalactic amusement park Moron Mountain who seeks to enslave the Looney Tunes as his newest attractions.
Released theatrically by Warner Bros. Pictures on November 15, 1996, Space Jam received largely mixed reviews from critics but was a box office success, opening at No. 1 in the North American box office and grossing over $230 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing basketball film of all time.
A sequel, titled Space Jam 2 and starring LeBron James, is scheduled for release on July 16, 2021.
