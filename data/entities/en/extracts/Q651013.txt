Roberto Valturio (1405â€“1475) was an Italian engineer and writer born in Rimini. He was the author of the military treatise De Re militari (1472).
The work consists of a preface, with a dedication to Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta; a list of the classical works mentioned and an introduction on the history of warfare. The work was widely known: the French King Louis XI of France, the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus, the Duke of Urbino Federico da Montefeltro and the ruler of Florence Lorenzo de' Medici had a copy of the printed book. In Leonardo da Vinci's list of books Roberto Valturio has been mentioned. This indicates that Leonardo had been in the possession of Roberto's work.
