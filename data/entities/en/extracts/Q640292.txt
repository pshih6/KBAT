Vittorio Mussolini (27 September 1916 â€“ 12 June 1997) was an Italian film critic and producer.  He was also the second son of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.  However, he was the first officially acknowledged son of Mussolini, with his second wife Rachele; his older half-brother was never officially acknowledged by Mussolini's fascist regime.
