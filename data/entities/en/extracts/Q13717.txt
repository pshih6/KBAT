Libération (French: [li.be.ʁa.sjɔ̃]), popularly known as Libé ([li.be]), is a daily newspaper in France, founded in Paris by Jean-Paul Sartre and Serge July in 1973 in the wake of the protest movements of May 1968.
Initially positioned on the extreme-left of France’s political spectrum, the editorial line evolved towards a more centre-left stance at the end of the 1970s. Its editorial stance was centre-left as of 2012.The publication describes its “DNA” as being “liberal libertarian”. It aims to act as a common platform for the diverse tendencies within the French left, with its “compass” being “the defence of freedoms and of minorities”. Edouard de Rothschild's acquisition of a 37% capital interest in 2005 and editor Serge July's campaign for the "yes" vote in the referendum establishing a Constitution for Europe the same year alienated it from a number of its left-wing readers.In its early days it was noted for its irreverent and humorous style and unorthodox journalistic culture. All employees, including management, received the same salary. In addition to traditional editor's notes, known as Note de la rédaction and marked as N.D.L.R., it included the innovative NDLC (note de la claviste), apt and witty comments inserted at the last moment by the typesetter.It was the first French daily to have a website. It had a circulation of about 67,000 in 2018.
