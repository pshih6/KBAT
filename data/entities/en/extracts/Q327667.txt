Women Without Men is a 2009 film adaptation of a Shahrnush Parsipur novel, directed by Shirin Neshat. Neshat's work explores gender issues in the Islamic world. Women without Men is her first dramatic feature.
The film profiles the lives of four women living in Tehran in 1953, during the American-backed coup that returned the Shah of Iran to power. The film was called "visually transfixing" by The New York Times reviewer Stephen Holden, who added, "the film surpasses even Michael Haneke's The White Ribbon in the fierce beauty and precision of its cinematography (by Martin Gschlacht)."
Two of the film's recurrent images are of a long dirt road extending to the horizon on which the characters walk, and a river that suggests, "a deep current of feminine resilience below an impassive exterior."
