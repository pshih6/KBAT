Bart Preneel (born 15 October 1963) is a Flemish cryptographer and cryptanalyst. He is a professor at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, in the COSIC group.  He was the president of the International Association for Cryptologic Research in 2008-2013 and project manager of ECRYPT.
Along with Shoji Miyaguchi, he invented the Miyaguchiâ€“Preneel scheme, a complex structure used in hash functions such as Whirlpool.  He is one of the authors of the RIPEMD-160 hash function.  He was also a co-inventor of the stream cipher MUGI which would later become a Japanese standard, and of the stream cipher Trivium which was a well-received entrant to the eSTREAM project.
He has also contributed to the cryptanalysis of RC4, SOBER-t32, MacGuffin, Helix, Phelix, Py, TPypy, the HAVAL cryptographic hash function as well as the SecurID hash function.
