Austrian Airlines AG, sometimes shortened to Austrian, is the flag carrier of Austria and a subsidiary of the Lufthansa Group. The airline is headquartered on the grounds of Vienna International Airport in Schwechat where it also maintains its hub. It flew to six domestic and more than 120 international year-round and seasonal destinations in 55 countries as of July 2016, and is a member of the Star Alliance. The airline temporarily suspended operations on 17 March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.
The airline was formed in 1957 by the merger of Air Austria and Austrian Airways but traces its history back to 1923 at the founding of Austrian Airways. During the 2000s, the airline expanded through the acquisitions of Rheintalflug and Lauda Air and adopted the shortened Austrian name in 2003. Throughout the decade, Austrian sustained several years of losses, and in 2008, its owner, the Austrian government, was advised to sell the airline to a foreign company. In 2009, the Lufthansa Group purchased the airline after receiving approval from the European Commission following an investigation into the tendering process.
Following disputes with staff over cost cutting, all Austrian Airlines' flights were transferred on 1 July 2012 to its subsidiary, Tyrolean Airways, which operated under the Austrian name. On 1 April 2015, all flights transferred back to Austrian, and Tyrolean Airways was merged into its parent.
