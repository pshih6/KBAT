A flight attendant (also known as steward/stewardess or air host/air hostess) is a member of an aircrew employed by airlines aboard commercial flights, primarily to ensure the safety and comfort of passengers. Collectively called the cabin crew, flight attendants are deployed in the cabins of all commercial flights and additionally may also be present on some private or business jets and government or military aircraft.
