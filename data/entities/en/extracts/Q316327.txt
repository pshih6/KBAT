José Maria de Eça de Queirós (European Portuguese: [ʒuˈzɛ mɐˈɾiɐ dɨ ˈɛsɐ dɨ kejˈɾɔʃ]; 25 November 1845 – 16 August 1900) is generally considered to have been the greatest Portuguese writer in the realist style. Zola considered him to be far greater than Flaubert. In the London Observer, Jonathan Keates ranked him alongside Dickens, Balzac and Tolstoy. During his lifetime the spelling was Eça de Queiroz, and this is the form that appears on many editions of his works; the modern standard Portuguese spelling is "Eça de Queirós".
