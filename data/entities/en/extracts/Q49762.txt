The Christian Democratic Union of Germany (German: Christlich Demokratische Union Deutschlands or CDU; German pronunciation: [ˈkʁɪstlɪç ˌdemoˈkʁaːtɪʃə ʔuˈni̯oːn ˈdɔʏtʃlants]) is a Christian-democratic, liberal-conservative political party in Germany. It is the major catch-all party of the centre-right in German politics. The CDU forms the CDU/CSU grouping, also known as the Union, in the Bundestag with its Bavarian counterpart the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU). Founded in 1945 as an interdenominational Christian party, the CDU effectively replaced the pre-war Catholic Centre Party, but also included politicians of other backgrounds, liberal and conservative. The party therefore claims to represent "Christian-social, liberal and conservative" elements.The leader of the CDU is Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. She is the successor of former party leader Angela Merkel, the current Chancellor of Germany. On 10 February 2020, after several political scandals, Kramp-Karrenbauer announced she would resign from the party leadership. The CDU is a member of the Centrist Democrat International, the International Democrat Union and the European People's Party (EPP).
