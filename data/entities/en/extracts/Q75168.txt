Walter Kreiser (10 February 1898 in Heilbronn - 1958 in Maringá, Brazil) was a German aircraft designer and journalist, best known for publishing an article in the magazine The World Stage in 1929, which exposed the secret creation of a secret German Air Force in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. Its publication resulted in him being convicted in 1931 of treason and espionage, receiving 18 months in prison (Weltbühne-Prozess) along with future (1935) Nobel Peace Prize winner Carl Ossietzky.
