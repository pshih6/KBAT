A journalist is a person who collects, writes, or distributes news or other current information to the public. A journalist's work is called journalism. From scribes and sailors to printing presses and streamed broadcasts, what it means to be a journalist has evolved over the course of centuries. Traditionally, journalists attend professional schools to learn the specialized skills, law, ethics and theory needed to conduct effective journalism. However, in a changing technological landscape, citizen and blogger journalism has also taken rise.
