Quintin McGarel Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone,  (9 October 1907 â€“ 12 October 2001), known as the 2nd Viscount Hailsham between 1950 and 1963, when he disclaimed the peerage, was a British barrister and Conservative politician.
Like his father, Hailsham was considered to be a contender for the leadership of the Conservative Party. He was a contender to succeed Harold Macmillan as prime minister in 1963, renouncing his hereditary peerage to do so, but was passed over in favour of the Earl of Home. He was created a life peer in 1970 and served as Lord Chancellor, the office formerly held by his father, until 1987.
