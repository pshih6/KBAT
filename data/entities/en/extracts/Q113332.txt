Leopold Poetsch (or Pötsch) (18 November 1853 – 16 October 1942) was an Austrian history teacher. He was a high school teacher of Adolf Hitler and Adolf Eichmann. He influenced the future leader's later views, specifically German nationalism.
He also took some distance from his former pupil, among other things since considering Hitler had become an enemy of Austria. (Eleonore Kandl: Hitlers Österreichbild. Dissertation Wien 1963, S. 38. Zitiert nach Klösch, S. 40. = citation in German wiki for this info)
Hitler credits the determining factor of the entire rest of his future life to Leopold in his book Mein Kampf.
