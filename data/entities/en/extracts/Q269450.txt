Suffocation is an American death metal band formed in 1988 in Centereach, New York. The band consists of lead guitarist Terrance Hobbs, bassist Derek Boyer, rhythm guitarist Charlie Errigo, drummer Eric Morotti, and vocalist Ricky Myers. Suffocation rose to prominence with their 1991 debut album Effigy of the Forgotten, which became a blueprint for death metal in the 1990s. Since then, the band has released a further seven albums. Their raw death metal style uses growled vocals with a downtuned guitar, fast and complex guitar riffs and drumming, open chord notes, occasional breakdowns (slams), and a sophisticated sense of songwriting.
