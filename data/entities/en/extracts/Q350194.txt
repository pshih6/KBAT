Alan Hugh Dale (born 6 May 1947) is a New Zealand-born actor. As a child, Dale enjoyed theatre and  rugby. After retiring from the sport, he took on a number of professions, before deciding to become a professional actor at age 27. With work limited in New Zealand, Dale moved to Australia, where he played Dr. John Forrest in The Young Doctors from 1979 to 1982. He later appeared as Jim Robinson in Neighbours, a part he played from 1985 until 1993. He left the series when he fell out with the producers over the pay he and the rest of the cast received. In 2018 it was revealed that Dale would reprise his role as Jim for one episode on December 25, 25 years after his last appearance.

Since then, he has had roles in many American series including prominent parts in The O.C. (as Caleb Nichol) and Ugly Betty (as Bradford Meade), as well as recurring and guest roles in Lost, 24, NCIS, ER, The West Wing, The X-Files, Entourage and Once Upon a Time.
