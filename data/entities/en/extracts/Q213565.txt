Moses (Moshe) Hess (January or June 21, 1812 â€“ April 6, 1875) was a French-Jewish philosopher and a founder of Labor Zionism. His socialist theories, predicated on racial struggle,  led to conflict with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. A devoted Spinozist, Hess was profoundly influenced by Spinoza's life and philosophy.
