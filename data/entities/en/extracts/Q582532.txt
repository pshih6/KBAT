Vicent Andrés Estellés (Valencian pronunciation: [biˈsɛn anˈdɾes esteˈʎes]; 4 September 1924 in Burjassot, Valencia – 27 March 1993 in Valencia) was a Spanish journalist and poet. He is considered one of the main renovators of modern Valencian poetry, with a similar role to that of Ausiàs March or Joan Roís de Corella in earlier periods.
