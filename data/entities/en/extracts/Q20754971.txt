The Free University of Brussels (French: Université libre de Bruxelles, or ULB) was a university in Brussels, Belgium. Founded in 1834 on the principle of "free inquiry" (libre examen), its founders envisaged the institution as a free-thinker reaction to the traditional dominance of Catholicism in Belgian education. The institutions was avowedly secular and particularly associated with Liberal political movements during the era of pillarisation. The Free University was one of Belgium's major universities, together with the Catholic University of Leuven and the universities of Ghent, and Liège.
The "Linguistic Wars" affected the Free University, which split along language lines in 1969 becoming the second Belgian university to do so. Today two institutions carry the "Free University of Brussels" name: the French-speaking Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB) and the Dutch-speaking Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB). Both institutions continue to collaborate under the auspices of an umbrella organisation known as Brussels Free Universities.
