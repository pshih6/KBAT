Pepi, Luci, Bom y otras chicas del mont칩n (Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Average Girls, or Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Girls Like Mom) is a 1980 Spanish film, a campy comedy, written and directed by Pedro Almod칩var. Starring Carmen Maura, Alaska, and Eva Siva, the plot follows the wild adventures of three friends: Pepi, an independent modern woman; Luci, a mousy, masochistic housewife; and Bom, a lesbian punk rock singer.
Pepi, Luci, Bom is Almod칩var's first feature film. It was shot in 16mm and blown up to 35mm for its theatrical release. It became a cult film, emblematic of La Movida Madrile침a, a period characterized by a sense of cultural and sexual freedom.
