Stanislav Ianevski, born Stanislav Yanevski (Bulgarian: Станислав Яневски [stɐniˈsɫaf ˈjanɛfski]; on 16 May 1985), is a Bulgarian actor who is perhaps best known for playing Viktor Krum in the 2005 fantasy film Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
Yanevski was born in Sofia, Bulgaria, and lived in England for five years, as well as Israel.  While attending Mill Hill School in the United Kingdom with fellow Harry Potter actor Harry Melling Ianevski had no particular acting aspirations and was not a drama student. He had only auditioned for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire after being spotted by Fiona Weir, a casting director who prompted him to attend an acting workshop, which resulted in his casting as Viktor Krum, a Bulgarian character in the Harry Potter series.  He was selected from 650 others, most of whom had auditioned in Sofia. He also starred in Hostel: Part II, the sequel to Eli Roth's film Hostel.
