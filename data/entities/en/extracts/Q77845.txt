Paul Rohrbach (29 June 1869 – 19 July 1956) was a German writer, concerned with "world politics."  He was born at Irgen manor, Raņķi parish, Skrunda Municipality, Courland, Latvia. Between 1887 and 1896 he attended the universities of Dorpat, Berlin, and Strasbourg.
He traveled extensively in Asia (especially China) and Africa, and in 1903-06 he was Settlement Commissioner to southwest Africa.  His writings include many books on political conditions in the countries visited by him, with much attention to the effects of German colonization and interests.  His Der deutsche Gedanke in der Welt was translated into English by Edmund von Mach as German World Policies (1915), and Der Krieg und die deutsche Politik (1914) appeared in an English translation by P. H. Phillipson as Germany's Isolation:  An Exposition of the Economic Causes of the Great War (1915). Most of the latter book was written before the start of the First World War.
Rohrbach was an advocate of eradicating native Africans in order to make room for German colonists.
