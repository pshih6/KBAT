Richard Wagner (born 10 April 1952) is a Romanian-born German novelist. He has published a number of short stories, novels and essays.
A member of Romania's German minority, like his former wife, Herta Müller, he studied German and Romanian literature at Timișoara University. He then worked as a German language school teacher and as a journalist, and published poetry and short stories in German. He was also a member of Aktionsgruppe Banat, a German-speaking literary society.
In 1987, Wagner and Müller left Romania for West Berlin, to escape communist oppression and censorship in Nicolae Ceaușescu's Romania. He still lives in Berlin.
