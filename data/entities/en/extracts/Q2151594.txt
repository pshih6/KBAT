Richard Michael Nolan (born December 17, 1943) is an American politician, businessman and member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party who served as the U.S. Representative from Minnesota's 8th congressional district from 2013 to 2019. He previously served as the U.S. Representative from Minnesota's 6th congressional district between 1975 and 1981.
After re-entering politics in 2011, he was nominated to challenge first-term incumbent Republican Chip Cravaack in the 8th district, defeating him on November 6, 2012. Nolan was re-elected in 2014 and 2016.
Nolan's 32-year gap between terms in Congress is the longest such break in service in American political history. On February 9, 2018, Nolan announced he would retire from Congress at the end of his current term. Nolan ran for Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota as the running mate of Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson in the 2018 gubernatorial election.  They were defeated in the August primary by Tim Walz and Peggy Flanagan.
