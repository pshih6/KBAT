Christian Dietrich Grabbe (11 December 1801 – 12 September 1836) was a German dramatist of the Vormärz era. He wrote many historical plays conceiving a disillusioned and pessimistic world view, with some shrill scenes. Heinrich Heine saw him as one of Germany's foremost dramatists, calling him "a drunken Shakespeare" and Sigmund Freud described Grabbe as "an original and rather peculiar poet."
