Robert Southey ( or ; 12 August 1774 â€“ 21 March 1843) was an English poet of the Romantic school, one of the Lake Poets along with William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and England's Poet Laureate for 30 years from 1813 until his death in 1843. Although his fame has been eclipsed by that of Wordsworth and Coleridge, his verse still enjoys some popularity. The English word "zombie", from the Haitian French "zombi", is purported to have first been recorded by Southey in his 1819 essay History of Brazil.
