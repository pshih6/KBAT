Lydia Thompson (born Eliza Thompson; 19 February 1838 â€“ 17 November 1908), was an English dancer, comedian, actress, and theatrical producer.
After dancing and performing in pantomimes in Britain and then in Europe as a teenager in the 1850s, she became a leading dancer and actress in burlesques on the London stage.  She introduced Victorian burlesque to America with her troupe the "British Blondes", in 1868, to great acclaim and notoriety.  Her career began to decline in the 1890s, but she continued to perform into the early years of the 20th century.
