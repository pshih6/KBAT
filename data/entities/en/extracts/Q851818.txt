Ninjago is a computer-animated television series produced by The Lego Group. It was created to coincide with the Lego Ninjago line of construction toys, many of which are based on elements of the series. It centers on the fictional world of Ninjago, telling the story of a group of teenage Ninja and their battles against the forces of evil. The series was animated in Copenhagen, Denmark, by Wil Film ApS for the first ten seasons, subtitled "Masters of Spinjitzu". Animation was relocated to WildBrain Studios in Canada starting with the eleventh season. The English-language voice cast has been recorded in Canada for its entire run. As of 2020 it is the longest currently running series airing on Cartoon Network. 
Ninjago began with two pilot episodes in January 2011, which were followed by two 13-episode seasons that aired from January to November 2012. Both the Lego theme and the series had an intended shelf life of three years, so the second season was originally intended to be the last. However, continued success of the series and its product line led to the show continuing ever since with twelve seasons being produced as of 2020.
The series was created by Michael Hegner and Tommy Andreasen, two Danish film producers. In Denmark, where the series' original production companies are located, Ninjago premiered on Nickelodeon. It airs on various Nickelodeon networks internationally and on Cartoon Network in the United States, United Kingdom and Poland. In Canada, the series is broadcast on Teletoon and YTV.
