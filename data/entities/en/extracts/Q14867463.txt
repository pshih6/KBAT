VIVA (abbreviation for: Videoverwertungsanstalt) was a German free-to-air music television channel, first broadcast on 1 December 1993. The channel was intended to compete against MTV Europe and was the first German-language music TV channel, while MTV was only broadcast in English until the introduction of MTV Germany in 1997. It was also supposed to focus more on German music and pop culture while MTV only broadcast anglophone music by artists mostly from North America, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia.
After years of competition for audience share, MTV Networks Europe eventually acquired VIVA on 14 January 2005 after it had outrun its own efforts for better ratings. MTV operated VIVA channels in Austria, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 
In June 2018, Viacom announced that it would shut down all Viva operations worldwide at the end of 2018.
The channel ceased to broadcast at 14:00 on 31 December 2018, being replaced by Comedy Central.
