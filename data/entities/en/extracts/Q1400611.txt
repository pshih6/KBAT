Franz "Schnuckenack" Reinhardt (17 February 1921 â€“ 15 April 2006) was a gypsy jazz musician (violinist), composer and interpreter. He was considered the "great violin virtuoso of Sinti music."  He was a German Sinto; his music was mostly published and categorized under the contemporary names gypsy jazz or "Musik deutscher Zigeuner" (music of German gypsies). He "made this music accessible to a broad public" and made the most significant contribution to the presentation of gypsy music and jazz in Germany into a concert form. He was the pioneer of this style of music in Germany and directly or indirectly inspired many of the succeeding generation of gypsy jazz players in that country, as well as preserving on record a great many folkloric and gypsy compositions for future generations.
