Augustus D. Juilliard (April 19, 1836 â€“ April 25, 1919) was an American businessman and philanthropist, born at sea as his parents were immigrating to the United States from France. Making a successful career in New York City, he bequeathed much of his estate to the advancement of music in the United States.
Trustees of his estate set up the Juilliard Foundation in 1920 to accomplish his goals, and in 1924 established The Juilliard School in New York City as a graduate music conservatory. Gradually programs were added in dance and theater.
